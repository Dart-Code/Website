# v2.23.1 *2019-02-21*

A bug that resulted in SDK detection failures if you had a folder named `flutter` inside your project has been fixed.

# v2.23.0 *2019-02-15*

## Dart: New Project

A new command **Dart: New Project** has been added that works similar to the existing **Flutter: New Project** and **Flutter: New Project From Docs** commands:

This command uses [Stagehand](https://github.com/dart-lang/stagehand/blob/master/README.md) to provide project templates. If you've not activated Stagehand before you'll be prompted to do so the first time you use it. Clicking **Activate Stagehand** will automatically run `pub global activate stagehand` for you.

You'll be presented with a list of project templates from Stagehand. The templates you see may vary based on the version of Stagehand you have activated.

After selecting a template you'll be prompted for a name and folder and your project will be created and opened automatically.

## Customizable Debugger Restart Button Behaviour

The restart button on the debug toolbar is now customizable for Flutter debug sessions.

In the VS Code user settings you'll find an option named **Flutter Debugger Restart Behaviour** which allows you to change the behaviour of the restart button (and corresponding command/menu items) between **Hot Reload** and **Hot Restart**. The default behaviour remains as hot reload (though depending on feedback this could change in future).

## Improved Project Picker

When running a command that requires a project root (for example **Pub: Get Packages**) that isn't clear from your active file, you're prompted for a folder. The built-in workspace-folder picker has been replaced with one that shows only Dart projects and can include sub-folders.

## Improved Flutter Build Progress

The build progress shown during a Flutter build has been improved and now remains on-screen for the whole duration of the build rather than appearing and disappearing at each build step.

## Flutter Extension Reminder

If you don't yet have the Flutter extension installed, you'll be reminded to install it when you open a Flutter project. In the future, some Flutter functionality will migrate from Dart to the Flutter Extension so installing it now will avoid any disruption.

## Other Changes

- Hot-reload-on-save no longer fires in Profile/Release builds resulting in "unsupported" messages being displayed.
- `deviceId` is now considered a valid in launch.json for attach configurations.
- Newlines have been restored to Flutter error messages that were lost in the previous version.
- The **Flutter: Upgrade** command now works correctly when you do not have a Dart/Flutter project open
- Running `pub get` when saving `pubspec.yaml` will now be delayed by 10 seconds if the file was auto-saved.
- Using the Firebase Flutter plugin should no longer show "Invalid JSON" messages in the debug console.
- Code completion now performs better when typing `: ` after a named argument.
- Single-line Dartdoc directives (like `{@macro some.cryptic.value}`) will no longer appear in tooltips.
- Performance of moving your cursor around when on a slow (eg. remote) file system is improved and should reduce the chance of "Extension host not responding" messages.
- Debugger toggles are now synced when another debugger is attached to the VM.
- "Unknown instance kind: Null" will no longer appear in the debug console when hovering over a null variable during debugging.
- A previous bugfix for ignoring `dart` binaries in `PATH` that were not real Dart VMs has returned (without the additional bugs).
- Symlinks to `dart` in `PATH` that are not in a folder named `bin` will no result in a failure to find the SDK.
- A new setting `dart.buildRunnerAdditionalArgs` has been added to allow passing additional args to build_runner tasks:
  ```js
  "dart.buildRunnerAdditionalArgs": [
      "--delete-conflicting-outputs"
  ]
  ```
