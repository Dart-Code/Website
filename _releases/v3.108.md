# v3.108.0 _2025-04-01_

## Experimental: DevTools Embedded in Sidebar

[#5396](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5396)/[#5367](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5367)/[#5466](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5466): A new experiment allows embedding DevTools pages inside the sidebar instead of as editor tabs. Trying this out requires enabling an experiment flag and then using the hidden value `"sidebar"` in the `dart.devToolsLocation` setting:

```js
// Enable the experiment
"dart.experimentalSidebarDevTools": true,
// Customise which sections are shown in the sidebar, in an editor tab, or external browser.
"dart.devToolsLocation": {
	"inspector": "sidebar",    // Embed inspector insidebar
	"default": "beside",       // Default to an editor tab besides the current code editor
	"cpu-profiler": "external" // Open the CPU profiler in external browser
},
```

Please provide feedback on this feature in the [Dart-Code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues). [Existing known issues can be found here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22in%20devtools%22).

## Testing

- [#5456](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5456): Because the Dart SDK repository now uses Pub Workspaces, the `dart.experimentalTestRunnerInSdk` setting has been removed and the test runner functionality is available when working in the Dart SDK repository automatically.

## Terminal

- [#5442](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5442): Invalid `.dart_tool/package_config.json` files no longer cause unhandled exceptions that could prevent other packages from being detected correctly for creating clickable links in the terminal.

## Misc

- [#5447](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5447)/[#5448](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5448): [@davidmartos96](https://github.com/davidmartos96) contributed a fix to prefer launching `studio` over `stduio.sh` when started Android Studio to avoid a warning when Android Studio opens.
- [#5458](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5458): The analysis server diagnostic pages and exportable report now include some useful values from the VS Code settings (such as whether formatting or other code actions are enabled on-save).
- [#5433](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5433): The extension no longer tries to inject settings into all configuration provided to the server, regardless of whether it's the Dart configuration or not.
- [#5090](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5090): The `dart.previewDtdLspIntegration` setting has been removed and the analysis server will now always connect to DTD when using a supported SDK version. If you are interested in integrating with the analysis server over DTD please [see this issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/60377) about capabilities.

## Documentation

- [#5453](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5453): The description of the `toolArgs` launch configuration field has been updated to not use `dart run` as an example, as Dart scripts are currently launched by the debug adapter without `run`.
- [#5431](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5431): The **Dart: DevTools Browser** setting is now documented as only working for local workspaces. Remote workspaces always use the default browser.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

[#5426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5426)/[#5444](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5444): When debugging on the latest SDKs, "inline values" will show for local variables and parameters.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.108/inline_values.png" width="680" height="160" />

Additionally, enabling the hidden setting `"dart.experimentalInlineValuesProperties": true` will show inline values for getters. If you try out these features, please provide feedback on GitHub (useful feedback includes where values may appear unexpectedly, or expected values not showing up).

- [#3948](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3948): Due to changes in Flutter to write localizations into your own app, localizations will no longer sometimes be missing from code completion/quick fixes.
