# v2.2.0

- When running on Mac OS + iOS breakpoints should work from first launch without having to hot reload first
- A new **Dart: Sort Members** command has been added
- The **Debug: Start without Debugging** command will no longer error if this is the first time running a project (where the `.vscode\launch.json` file does not exist)
- A new setting `sdkContainer` has been added which can be used for fast SDK switching - set to a folder that contains multiple SDKs and the Dart SDK version in the status bar will become clickable
