# v2.2.0

- When running on Mac OS + iOS breakpoints should work from first launch without having to `hot reload` first
- A new `Sort Members` command has been added
- `Start without debugging` will no longer error if this is the first time running a project (where the `.vscode\launch.json` file does not exist)
- A new setting `sdkContainer` has been added which can be used for fast SDK switching - set to a folder that contains multiple SDKs and the Dart SDK version in the status bar will become clickable
