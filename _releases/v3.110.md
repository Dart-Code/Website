# v3.110.0 _2025-05-01_

## Flutter

- [#5494](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5494): When enabling a new platform for a project, default files like `test/test_main.dart` are no longer recreated.
- [#5498](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5498): After selecting to enable a new platform, an additional confirmation prompt is no longer shown and the platform is enabled immediately.

## Commands

- [#5500](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5500): The "Copy VM Service URI" command now provides options to copy both internal and exposed URIs when running in a remote session (such as SSH or Firebase Studio).
- [#5501](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5501): The "Copy VM Service URI" command no longer shows an error stating that there are no debug sessions available if you cancel from the debug session prompt.

## Testing

- [#5489](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5489): In multi-root workspaces, workspace folder names are now included in the test runner tree labels.
- [#5488](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5488): Test suites are no longer sometimes duplicated in the test runner if they are both discovered statically and provide test results during a debug session.

## Misc

- [#5490](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5490): `analysis_options.yaml` and `.dart_tool` have been added to the list of files that trigger activation of the Dart Extension. This may help the extension activate earlier when opening some workspaces where Dart projects are deeply nested if one of these files/folders still exist within the top few levels.
- [#5320](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5320): Starting with the upcoming v1.100 of VS Code (not the Dart extension), autocompletion in YAML files will automatically trigger when typing.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5496](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5496): "An error occurred while handling textDocument/rename request" no longer occurs when renaming a closure parameter.
