# v3.20.1 *2021-03-03*

- [#3173](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3173): LSP Support is now enabled by default for some users. This will be extended over coming releases to include all users though can be opted-out by explicitly setting the `dart.previewLsp` setting to `false`.

# v3.20.0 *2021-03-01*

## Testing

[#3048](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3048)/[#3131](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3131): The ability to run Skipped tests (`--run-skipped`) has been added to the test runner toolbar and context menus. This is currently only supported for Dart projects but will be [enabled for Flutter projects](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3151) in a future version. This allows a tests to be run even if they are annotated with `skip: true` to check their status without needing to modify the code.

[#3097](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3097): Additionally, running a specific test from CodeLens links will always pass `--run-skipped` when supported, making it easy to run skipped tests directly from the editor.

Other test runner changes include:

- [#3156](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3156): Test suite/group nodes overall status now only shows as Skipped if the whole group is skipped (if a group has a mix of pass/skip the overall status will show as Passed).
- [#3146](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3146): Viewing test output from the last run of a test has been moved to the context menu rather than automatically opening when clicking on a test in the tree (this caused some confusion due to switching from the Debug Console to a pseudo terminal).
- [#3119](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3119): Newlines in test/group names are now removed to show more of the name in the test tree node.
- [#3154](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3154): Test output is now cleared on each new run, so only output from the last is shown.

## Flutter

[#3110](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3110)/[#3122](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3122): The hot-reload-on-save setting now has an additional option to reload on all saves (including auto-saves) as well as just manual saves.

- [#3118](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3118)/[#3123](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3123): The `hotReloadProgress` no longer (incorrectly) applies to build progress. Build progress will once again show as notifications regardless of this setting.
- [#3149](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3149): When Flutter needs initializing at project load (for example after an SDK update), a different Dart SDK version (for example from `PATH`) will no longer be selected instead of the one provided by the Flutter SDK.

## Editor

_Items here marked "(requires SDK update)" rely on changes in the Dart/Flutter SDKs so may not be immediately visible depending on your Dart/Flutter SDK channel._

- [#3141](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3141): The **Create file** quick-fix on `import`s no longer fails to create files when using LSP _(requires SDK update)_.
- [#3104](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3104): New `import`s inserted by fixes or code completion will no longer be inserted above file-wide annotations such as `@TestOn()` _(requires SDK update)_.
- [#3103](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3103): The **Extract Method** and **Extract Widget** refactors now prompt for names when using LSP.
- [#3074](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3074): Changes made to generated Flutter localizations (in the synthetic `l10n_gen` package) are now detected by the analyzer without a restart _(requires SDK update)_.
- [#2998](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2998): Code completion now supports "insert mode" (`Shift`+`Enter`) when using LSP _(requires SDK update)_.
- [#2854](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2854): The warning "Code actions of kind 'quickfix 'requested but returned code action is of kind 'refactor.extract'." is no longer shown in the console when key-binding specific fixes.
- [#584](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/584): Refactors/fixes that insert multiline code generate correct indentation when using LSP.
- [#2816](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2816): Renaming a named constructor no longer adds an additional dot in Dartdoc comments, breaking the reference to the constructor _(requires SDK update)_.
- [#3161](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3161): When using LSP with semantic tokens, the `@` of annotations are now coloured the same as variables by default.

## Debugger

- [#3167](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3167): Launching non-Flutter web apps no longer fails with an error about "devtools-server-address" if DevTools has been started for the current session.

## Commands

- [#3162](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3162): The current DevTools version is now shown in a tooltip when hovering over DevTools in the status bar.
- [#3158](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3158): The **Dart: Reanalyze Project** and **Open Diagnostic Server** commands no longer fail when using LSP.
- [#3145](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3145): The **Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor** command no longer reports a spurious error if Flutter failed to initialize at startup.
- [#3138](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3138): Activating global Pub packages like `devtools` and `webdev` will no longer report failures if the latest published stable version is not compatible with your current SDK.

## Other

- [#3142](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3142): DevTools is no longer eagerly/background-activated for non-Flutter workspaces.
- [#3120](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3120): New releases of DevTools are now detected and installed even when DevTools is eagerly/background activated.
- [#3135](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3135): Failing to send analytics no longer reports an error and disables sending analytics for that whole session.
