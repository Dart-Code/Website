# v3.124.0 _2025-12-01_

## Flutter Widget Preview

- [#2620](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2620): The Flutter Widget Preview is enabled by default when using the recently-released Flutter v3.38.
- [#5775](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5775): The Flutter Widget Preview now handles Pub Workspaces correctly, supporting previews for all projects within the Pub workspace.

## Flutter

- [#5782](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5782): Switching SDKs no longer reports "View provider for 'sidebarWidgetPreview' already registered".
- [#5783](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5783): The Widget Preview now shows the correct background color when embedded in the sidebar.
- [#5796](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5796): If the Flutter daemon times out unexpectedly on macOS, a notification will now be shown.

## Editor

- [#5599](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5599): Go-to-Definition now works on keywords like `return`, `break`, and `continue`, jumping to the corresponding token.
- [#4844](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4844): All exit points of a function/block such as `return`, `break`, and`continue` are highlighted together when the text cursor is in one of them.
- [#5810](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5810): The color picker/previews now appear when using the new dot shorthand syntax.
- [#5772](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5772): Raw strings (starting `r'` or `r"`) are now automatically closed just like normal strings.
- [#5754](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5754): The "Add 'foo' to dependencies" quick-fix now works correctly when the package name is a prefix of another existing dependency.
- [#5776](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5776): The `flutter/ephemeral`, `.symlinks` and `.plugin_symlinks` folders are now excluded from the explorer and search results by default. The `.dart_tool` folder is also now excluded from search results by default. If you'd prefer these were included, you can add them back to your `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` configuration respectively.
- [#5755](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5755): A one-off warning is now shown if the `dart.onlyAnalyzeProjectsWithOpenFiles` setting is enabled. Use of this setting is not recommended as it can cause bad performance when moving around the codebase.

## AI

- [#5785](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5785)/[#5795](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5795): When using Copilot, the Format and Fix All tool from the Dart MCP server (which only read and modify files on disk) are now replaced with extension-provided versions that work nicely with unsaved edits.
- [#5647](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5647): When using Copilot, the `analyze_files` tool from the Dart MCP server is now disabled in favour of the VS Code `problems` tool which provides live analysis errors from the open files and does not trigger re-analyzing files on disk.

## DevTools

- [#3488](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3488): When using Flutter v3.38 / Dart 3.10, using Cmd+C on macOS to copy from embedded DevTools pages should now work as expected.

## Testing

- [#5799](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5799)/[#5575](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5575): Code coverage is now enabled for Dart projects if using the latest version of `pkg:test`, however it currently only captures coverage for the current package. [#5798](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5798) is open to track adding support for all workspace packages (which is already supported for Flutter).
- [#5797](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5797): Code coverage reports that contain absolute Windows paths now parse correctly.
- [#5707](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5707)/[#5811](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5811): Running tests in defined in a non-`main` function no longer reports "No tests match regular expression ...".

## Commands

- [#5801](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5801)/[#5789](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5789): Commands like **Get Packages** now show the package name in the output instead of just the folder name (which is usually - but not always - the same).
- [#5777](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5777): When running **Pub Get** on a batch of packages, the notification now shows a progress indicator and the number of done/total packages.
- [#5803](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5803): The **Dart: Open Analyzer Diagnostics / Insights** command now show a progress indicator if it does not respond immediately (for example while the server is busy starting up).

## Extension API

- [#5770](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5770)/[#5703](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5703): Other VS Code extensions can now suppress debug CodeLenses via the exposed API. This allows projects like Jaspr to replace these with their own CodeLenses that invoke their own debugger.
- [#5587](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5587): Internal extension APIs intended for use only in automated test runs are no longer exposed outside of test runs.
