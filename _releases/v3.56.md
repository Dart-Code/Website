# v3.56.0 *2022-12-21*


## Editor

- [#4306](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4306): Variable names that include reserved words within them are no longer colored incorrectly when using a theme that doesn't support semantic tokens (or are disabled).
- [#4300](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4300): Functions and methods named `get` or `set` are no longer colored incorrectly when using a theme that doesn't support semantic tokens (or are disabled).
- [#4216](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4216): `extends`/`implements` clauses for classes with type parameters are no longer uncolored when using a theme that doesn't support semantic tokens (or are disabled).


## Flutter

- [#4294](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4294): Enabling a new target platform for a Flutter app through the device selector no longer silently fails to set up the platform.
- [#4313](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4313): Enabling the new SDK DAPs for Flutter pre-release branches by default has been temporarily reverted pending a fix for https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50802. The SDK DAPs can still be opted-in to using the `dart.previewSdkDaps` setting.


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically after you upgrade to the next (non-hotfix) Dart/Flutter SDK release. If you're using a recent `beta` or `master` version, these items should be available to you and any issues should be reported on GitHub in the usual way.

- [#4177](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4177): The **Extract variable** refactor now includes an explicit type when the `always_include_types` lint is enabled.
- [#4296](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4296): When using the new SDK DAPs, debugger views (Watch, Variables) no longer include private getters that always fail if the current stack frame is from in the library that declares them. These getters were already filtered out by the original/legacy DAPs.
- [#4291](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4291): When using the new SDK DAPs in a remote workspace, URLs hosting Flutter web apps and the debug proxy backend are now correctly exposed/mapped so they are accessible to the local client.
- [#4292](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4292): When using the new SDK DAPs in a remote workspace, Flutter web apps will now be automatically opened on the client (as was the case with original/legacy DAPs).
- [#4293](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4293): When using the web-server device with the new SDK DAPs, it will be clearer when Flutter is waiting for you to click on the Dart Debug extension button in the launched browser window.
