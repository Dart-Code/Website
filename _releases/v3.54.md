# v3.54.1 *2022-11-30*

- [#4290](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4290): Running the **Pub: Upgrade Packages** command will no longer sometimes run `pub get` instead of `pub upgrade`.

# v3.54.0 *2022-11-29*

## Improved Status Bar Information

[#4257](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4257): Several items that used to have their own status bar entries have been merged into VS Code's new language status area. This can be found from the `{}` icon next to the language in the status bar.

Clicking the "pin" icon against an entry will move it back to being always visible on the status bar.

## Flutter: New Project Platform Defaults

[#4284](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4284): When creating a new Flutter project using the **Flutter: New Project** command it's now possible to set the default platforms that should be enabled for new projects. This can be accessed from the "cog" icon when entering the project name.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.54/platforms_2.png" width="645" height="335" />

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.54/platforms_3.png" width="645" height="255" />

These can also be set directly via the `dart.flutterCreatePlatforms` setting.

## Flutter

- [#4089](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4089): `cmd/ctrl`+`click` is now supported on `file://` and `package:` links in the test error peek window.
- [#4283](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4283): The **Flutter: New Project** settings editor now pre-selects the existing selected values in single-selection lists.
- [#4276](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4276): The **Hot Reload** button and commands are now hidden if running your app in Profile/Release mode.
- [#4272](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4272): The entries for enabling new platforms in the device selector are now listed after a seperator to make them easier to find.
- [#4249](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4249): Chrome will no longer fail to be located if defined by `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` when using the new SDK debug adapters.

## Editor

- [#4255](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4255): A new command **Dart: Toggle Line Comment Kind** has been added that cycles through no comment, double-slashes, triple slashes.
- [#4253](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4253): An issue that prevented Pub package names (used by the **Dart: Add Dependency** command) from being cached locally has been resolved.
- [#3547](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3547): The `dart.showTodos` setting now accepts an array of strings and can be used to individually choose which `TODO`-style comments (of those supported by the analyzer - `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `UNDONE`) should be shown. This requires Dart SDK >= 2.18.

## Commands

- [#4261](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4261): Upon opening a project, if your Dart/Flutter SDK versions have changed since you last ran `pub` you will now be prompted to run `pub upgrade`.

## Testing

- [#4163](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4163): Gutter icons for helper methods that call `setUpAll`/`tearDownAll` will no longer appear on the wrong line.
- [#4286](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4286): `setUpAll` and `tearDownAll` results will no longer appear as runnable tests (which error if attempted to run). They still appear in the gutter/test tree to indicate their success/failure, but have no Run or Debug actions.


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically after you upgrade to the next (non-hotfix) Dart/Flutter SDK release. If you're using a recent `beta` or `master` version, these items should be available to you and any issues should be reported on GitHub in the usual way.


- [#4279](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4279): Some quick-fixes are now available for `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` files.
- [#4119](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4119): A new setting `dart.documentation` allows selecting what level of documentation (`none`, `summary`, `full`) should appear in hovers and code completion. The default is `full` to match previous behaviour.
- [#4268](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4268): A new 'Application (empty)' template is available when creating Flutter applications which is a stripped down version of the standard 'Application' template without all of the explanatory comments and test stubs.
- [#4136](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4136): Use of `Container()` has been changed to `Placeholder()` in many Flutter snippets.
- [#4116](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4116): Code completion for overriding methods now includes members that have unimported types in their signature. Additionally, code completion now supports adding multiple imports automatically to support the case where there are several unimported types in an override completion from different libraries that are not yet imported.
- [#3787](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3787): Code completion now shows correct constructor documentation for class constructors that are not yet imported into the current file.
- [#4144](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4144): Unimported extension members now show their documentation correctly in code completion.
- [#4242](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4242): Several issues with nested/overlapping code folding have been addressed.
- [#4269](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4269): Whole functions can now be folded (both parameters and body) in a single region.
- [#4243](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4243): '.dill' files will no longer sometimes be created alongside test files during test runs.
- [#4185](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4185): The 'Create Missing Overrides' fix no longer includes invalid non-nullable types in the selector for choosing types.
- [#4275](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4275): Analyzer plugins can now provide code completion entries that automatically import libraries.
- [#4128](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4128): Dart SDK sources are now correctly mapped when running Flutter applications using the new SDK debug adapters (currently behind the `"dart.previewSdkDaps": true` flag, but enabled by default for pre-release SDK users).
