# v3.50.0 *2022-10-03*

## Flutter

- [#3808](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3808): Attaching to a Flutter process started outside of VS Code no longer requires manual configuration of the `packages` file in order for the debugger to correctly locate files while debugging/stepping. This fix applies only to the new SDK DAPs (which can be opted-in to using the `dart.previewSdkDaps` setting).

## Editor

- [#4152](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4152): The "Run"/"Debug" CodeLens links now appear on the line directly above the `main` method name, and not above the related DartDoc comments.

## Other

- [#4178](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4178): In a multi-folder workspace, running a debug session without an explicit `cwd` or one that can be inferred from `program` will now use the nearest common ancestor of all open workspace folders (if one can be found that is not the drive root).
- [#4134](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4134): When using the **Dart: Capture Logs** commands, long lines are no longer truncated. Logs written to disk using the related settings are still truncated based on the `dart.maxLogLineLength` setting.

## Rollout of New SDK Debug Adapters

[#4194](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4194): Several issues that led to pausing the rollout of the [new SDK debug adapters](/releases/#new-debug-adapters-for-dart-and-flutter) have been resolved in latest bleeding-edge builds of Dart/Flutter. As such, rollout will continue when using an SDK version with these fixes (which is currently only users of the Flutter/Dart master branches).

Additionally, users of pre-release SDKs (with a sufficient version number to include the fixes noted above) will immediately be opted-in to the new DAPs (skipping the progressive rollout used on the stable branch). If you notice any unexpected behaviour while debugging (or while not debugging ðŸ™‚) please [file issues](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/new/choose) which as much detail as possible!

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or sooner if using beta/development channels - depending on the exact version).

- [#612](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/612): Call Hierarchy is now available (`Shift` + `Alt/Option` + `H`, or from the context menu).
- [#4154](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4154)/[#3609](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3609)/[#4160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4160): Inlay hints are now available for inferred types and parameter names (shown while holding `Ctrl` + `Alt/Option`).
- [#4143](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4143): Auto-imports now work when completing extension members.

- [#4121](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4121): Code folding regions that overlap the same line (such as parameter list and function bodies) have been adjusted since VS Code recently stopped supporting them.
- [#4120](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4120): Hovering over a constructor's parameters no longer show an oversized font for the type.
- [#4114](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4114): Navigation/resolution of DartDoc qualified references that reference members from a base class now work as expected.
- [#3182](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3182): Code completion now offers members that can be overridden when invoked in a completely empty class.
- [#4184](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4184): The **Create missing override(s)** quickfix now shows in completely empty classes.
- [#4181](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4181): Links for the "See code in" example links in Flutter no longer return additional unexpected results when trying to navigate with **Go to Definition** / `ctrl` + click.
- [#4169](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4169): The **Remove widget** assist is now available on widget calls prefixed with aliases.
- [#4167](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4167): The **Inline Method** refactor no longer fails if the method has type parameters.
- [#4157](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4157): **Find References** once again works when the caret is at the end of the symbol name (or the entire symbol name is selected). This issue only affected some recent pre-release versions of the SDK.
- [#4141](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4141): Hot Reload and Hot Restart now show progress notifications when using new SDK DAPs.
- [#4101](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4101): The Debug Console now focuses more quickly when launching an app using the new Flutter SDK DAP.
- [#3966](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3966): DevTools no longer sometimes fails to open if a previous window had been closed within the last 30 seconds.
- [#4149](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4149): Breakpoints will no longer fail to be hit on Windows when using SDK DAPs depending on the casing of the drive letter of the current working directory.
