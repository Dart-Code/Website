# v2.17.1

- Signature Help will only trigger automatically when pressing `(` or `,` if the `dart.triggerSignatureHelpAutomatically` setting is enabled (this may become default again in future when some issues are resolved)
- `dart.trackWidgetCreation` - which powers `Flutter: Inspect Widget` has been disabled by default while some issues are investigated
- Silent extension restarts should no longer fail when the Testing Code Lens is enabled

# v2.17.0

## Inspect Flutter Widget

When debugging a Flutter application a new command `Flutter: Inspect Widget` appears in the command palette which allows you to tap on a widget on your device/emulator to highlight it and jump directly to the source code where it was constructed.

**Note:** In v2.17.1 `dart.trackWidgetCreation` - which powers this feature - was disabled by default while a bug is investigated. You can enable this but may find issues when hot reloading. `flutter clean` after enabling the setting *may* resolve these issues. This setting will be re-enabled by default once these issues are fixed.

## Testing Improvements

Code Lens links now appear above tests and test groups that allow you to quickly run/debug an individual test or group without running the whole suite.

Several other improvements have been made to the test runner: 

- When running a test suite that has previous results, the previous results will become faded until they are replace with new results to give an indication of progress through the suite
- Test results for a suite should no longer vanish from the tree when you run a subset of that suites tests
- Tests should not appear duplicated in the tree if run as part of a while suite and then subsequently individually
- To reduce scrolling, test names are no longer prefixed with their group names in the tree
- Test suites with failures will now move to the top of the tree
- The Output pane will now update real-time if selected for a test that is currently running

## Flutter Screenshots

[@timsneath](https://github.com/timsneath) and [@Ramalus](https://github.com/Ramalus) contributed a `Flutter: Save Screenshot` command to save screenshots from your device/emulator. The first time you use it in a session you'll be prompted for a folder to save to (you can suppress this with the `dart.flutterScreenshotPath` setting) and shown a notification to quickly open the folder. This command can be found to a key in your VS Code key bindings the same as any other command.

## Signature Help

Signature help is now available to quickly look up arguments to functions without having to hover over them.

Signature help can be invoked with `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Space` (macOS: `Cmd`+`Shift`+`Space`) or if the `dart.triggerSignatureHelpAutomatically` setting is enabled, will appear automatically when you type `(` or `,`.

This feature relies on a new feature in the Dart SDK. At the time of release this is available in the Flutter `master` channel but not yet on `dev`/`beta` channels.

## Other Changes

- A new setting `dart.enableCompletionCommitCharacters` has been added to allow committing code completion with `(`, `[`, `,`, `.`) keys (this will become the default in a future release)
- `dart.sdkPath` no longer takes priority over Flutter's local SDK for Flutter projects
- A warning will be shown if you attempt to modify a file outside of your workspace (for example because you Go-to-Definition'd to a framework file)
- Long variables that were previously truncated when using `Copy Value` from the Watch pane's context menu should no longer truncate; however this also requires a VS Code fix (fixed in Insiders at time of release, but expected in Stable very soon)
- A new setting `dart.maxLogLineLength` has been added to control the truncation of long lines for all log files (setting to `null` will disable truncation - logging lots of long lines may affect performance!)
- All log files will now include SDK version numbers at the top (if they are available at the time of opening the log file)
