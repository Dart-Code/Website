# v3.40.0 *2022-05-??*

## Flutter

- [#3913](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3913): Previews for Flutter icons that begin with reserved terms (like `try`, `class`, `new`, `switch`) now appear correctly in Dartdocs.
- [#3912](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3912): When the `flutter` tool is run for the first time by the extension, the Output pane containing welcome text will remain visible instead of closing automatically.

## Debugger

- [#3937](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3937): The **Debug: Select & Start Debugging** command now includes a launch configuration for each available device. Clicking the cog icon will create a specific launch configuration in `launch.json` for that specific device, regardless of the current selected device.
- [#3918](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3918): Hot Restart no longer sometimes causes errors to be written to the VS Code developer console when an application has more than one isolate.

## Commands

- [#3924](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3924): The setting `dart.flutterCreateOffline` has been renamed to `dart.offline` and now passes `--offline` to other commands (such as `pub get`) in addition to `flutter create`.
- [#3920](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3920): A new setting `dart.devToolsLocation` replaces `dart.embedDevTools` to configure where DevTools should be launched. The default setting `"beside"` behaves the same as the previous embedding (opening in a tab beside the current editor). `"active"` open over the top of the current editor (which can be full-width). `"external"` opens in an external browser window.

## Other

- [#3922](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3922): `file:///` links for Dart files in the embedded terminal are now detected more reliably and should not lead to "Invalid file path" errors after clicking.
- [#3938](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3938): Activations of the Dart extension in workspaces that do not contain Dart/Flutter projects (such as when VS Code requests dynamic debug configs while working on another project) will no longer trigger Dart SDK update notifications.
- [#3919](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3919): Opening a project with no `pubspec.yaml` will no longer suppress the notification if a Dart SDK cannot be found.
- [#3933](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3933): The `dart-lang/sdk` repo is again detected correctly, disabling automatic `pub get` and related commands.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/dev channels that already include the SDK parts of these changes).

### Server-Provided Code Snippets

[#3904](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3904): When using a new enough SDK, the local code snippets are suppressed and snippets will be provided by the Dart LSP server. Server-provided snippets are contextual and can adapt to your project settings and language version, including:

- [#2059](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2059): Only snippets that are valid at the current location are shown (for example the `class` or `stful` snippets are only shown at the top level, and `if` and `switch` are not shown at the top level).
- [#3347](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3347): Nullability suffixes `?` are only included when null saftey is enabled.
- [#3899](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3899): [Super parameters](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/48055) may be used when available.
- [#3582](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3582): `List<String> args` are not included in `main()` functions for test files.

### Go to Type Definition

[#3833](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3833): Go to Type Definition allows navigating to the definition of a type of a symbol without first needing to navigate to the symbols definition.

## Flutter

- [#3921](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3921): When using the new SDK debugger implementations (`dart.experimentalSdkDaps`), detaching from a Flutter process will remove breakpoints and automatically resume.
- [#3837](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3837): The `--multidex`/`--no-multidex` flag now works correctly for launches of `flutter run` through the VS Code debugger (including defaulting to enabled).

## Editor

- [#3934](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3934): The ordering of diagnostics will now remain stable during typing (where the specific diagnostics do not change) to avoid VS Code's Peek Error (`F8`) functionality from changing the selected error during typing.
- [#3932](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3932): The `var` keyword is no longer highlighted differently when used in a `for` loop for some themes.
- [#3929](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3929): Opening loose `.dart` files that are not part of a project (with a `pubspec.yaml` or `analysis_options.yaml`) will no longer sometimes cause some "File is not being analyzed" errors during startup.
- [#3906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3906): Code completion for the named argument `children: []` will no longer insert `[]` if completion is invoked on the `children` label and a value is already present.
- [#3892](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3892): Accepting code completion suggestions should no longer sometimes delete additional characters when the system is under load/slow.
