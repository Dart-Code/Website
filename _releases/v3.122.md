# v3.122.0 _2025-10-30_

## Flutter

- [#5749](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5749): Important Flutter app warnings emitted by the Flutter tool are now surfaced directly as VS Code warning toast notifications.
- [#5744](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5744): The Flutter Widget Preview sidebar icon now appears after extension activation instead of only after the widget preview server initialises.

## Commands

- [#5549](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5549)[#5760](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5760): The **Pub Get** command now refreshes timestamps of both `pubspec.lock` and `package_config.json` preventing false notifications that the command needs running again when opening a project.
- [#5740](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5740)/[#5746](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5746): Progress notifications when running the **Pub Get** command for multiple packages in a batch are now combined into a single notification that updates with the package names, instead of flickering individual notifications.
- [#5745](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5745)/[#5746](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5746): When the **Pub Get** command is being run for multiple packages in a batch, a single cancellation will cancel the entire batch instead of only the current project.

## AI

- [#5733](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5733): Registration of the MCP server no longer forces the Dart extension to eargerly activate in non-Dart workspaces.
- [#5767](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5767): When running inside Cursor (which [does not support automatic MCP registration](https://forum.cursor.com/t/support-vs-codes-register-mcp-server-definition-provider-api/133031)), a prompt is shown to help install the Dart MCP Server explicitly.

## Testing

- [#5620](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5620): The `dart.suppressTimeouts` setting now works correctly when used inside Pub Workspaces.
- [#5763](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5763): The `dart.suppressTimeouts` setting now defaults to `debug`, which prevents test timeouts from firing when running in Debug mode.
- [#5668](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5668): The new test location tracking is now enabled by default and should improve the locations in the test explorer and gutter icons when using packages like `test_reflective_loader` that register tests dynamically.
- [#5738](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5738): The new test location tracking now monitors groups in addition to tests to ensure group nodes also stay in-sync in the test explorer/gutter.
- [#5734](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5734): The new test location tracking no longer causes test locations to snap back to previous locations during edits.

## Misc

- [#5747](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5747): Issue templates on GitHub have been updated to make it clearer that the Dart-Code issue tracker is used for both the Dart and Flutter extensions.
- [#5648](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5648): E2E tests have been expanded to include testing of the new Widget Preview.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5717](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5717): The Flutter Widget Preview will no longer require an experiment flag to appear (this currently applies to the latest beta, and will apply to the next stable).
- [#5759](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5759): Exceptions shown in the Watch window once again show only the relevant part of the error message instead of prefixes like "Unhandled exception:"
- [#5761](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5761): Changes to `package:reflective_test_loader` prevent `@FailingTest()` from causing timeouts if the test passes unexpectedly.
- [#5750](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5750): Nested folding ranges that end on the same line are no longer incorrectly truncated.
- [#5730](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5730): When using WiFi debugging wioth versions of iOS known to be slow, a warning will be shown.
- [#5724](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5724): The `--timeline_streams` flag will be automatically set when debugging Dart applications so that the same events show up in the DevTools Performance as for Flutter apps.
