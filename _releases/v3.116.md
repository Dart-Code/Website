# v3.116.0 _2025-07-31_

## Code Coverage for Flutter tests

[#2860](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2860): It's now possible to run tests while capturing coverage in Flutter projects. The "Run With Coverage" option appears in the test runner toolbar as well as against each individual test suite/test.

It also appears on the menu from the test gutter icons.

Coverage data will show in the gutter, and expand to highlight lines when hovered over. It's also shown in the Explorer tree and the Test Coverage when on the Testing sidebar.

## Flutter

- [#5612](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5612)/[#5617](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5617): Adding a Flutter project to a workspace that previously contained only Dart projects will now prompt to reload in order to switch to a Flutter SDK and start required Flutter services.
- [#5606](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5606)/[#5610](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5610): Interaction with Flutter's device daemon has been switched to newer APIs, avoiding "No devices found" on Flutter's `master` branch.
- [#5591](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5591): The **Flutter: New Project** command no longer shows the "Skeleton" option that was removed in Flutter 3.29.

## Dependencies Tree

[#5589](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5589)/[#5590](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5590): The Dependencies tree now includes an "Open on Pub" command on the context menu to quickly open the pub.dev page for a package.

## Dart-Code Extension API

- [#5008](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5008)/[#5583](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5583)/[#5595](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5595)/[#5601](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5601): New APIs are now exported by the extension to allow other VS Code extensions to reuse some of Dart-Code's functionality. The internal private APIs that were intended only for testing (but had been adopted by some extensions) will be removed in an upcoming release. If you maintain a VS Code extension that uses these APIs, please see https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5587 and ensure your extension is migrated.

## Misc

- [#5621](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5621)/[#5622](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5622): The `autolaunch.json` functionality now supports watching for modifications to the autolaunch file instead of only creation.
- [#5613](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5613): An environment variable `DART_CODE_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_DELAY` can now be used to delay the activation of background services like the Dart Tooling Daemon.
