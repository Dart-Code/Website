# v3.78.0 _2023-11-??_

## Flutter Sidebar

[#4762](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4762)/[#4833](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4833) If you've upgraded to the [recently-released Flutter 3.16](https://medium.com/flutter/whats-new-in-flutter-3-16-dba6cb1015d1) you'll have access to a new sidebar panel in VS Code when working on Flutter projects:

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.78/sidebar.jpg" width="720" height="764" />

The panel currently includes:

- a list of current running debug sessions with buttons to Hot Reload, Hot Restart, and to quickly launch DevTools features
- a list of connected devices that you can use to launch your application on

## Code Completion Signatures

[#2462](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2462): Also when using Flutter 3.16 / Dart 3.2, code completion has been improved to include more detailed signatures for all items instead of only the one currently selected.

## Lazy Getters in Debugger

[#4234](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4234): Setting `"dart.evaluateGettersInDebugViews": false` will no longer completely hide getters in debug views, but instead provide a clickable button that will evaluate them lazily.

To completely hide getters you can use the new setting `"dart.showGettersInDebugViews": false`.

## Flutter

- [#4571](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4571): When using the new SDK debug adapters, formatting of Flutter errors in the Debug Console has been improved to have the same colouring and emphasizing of user stack frames in stack traces as the legacy debug adapters.
- [#4823](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4823): The tooltip on the selected device in the status bar now updates correctly when devices change and includes counts of both all devices and those enabled for the current workspace.
- [#4839](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4839): Failures to launch Android emulators are no longer silent and will be shown in an Output pane.

## Editor

- [#4624](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4624): Inlay hints are now included for patterns.
- [#4837](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4837): An issue that caused closure code completions to stop showing up in Dart 3.2.0 has been fixed (and hot-fixed into Dart 3.2.2).

## DevTools

- [#4832](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4832): The "Open DevTools in browser" action should no longer sometimes fail when using the new Flutter sidebar panel.
- [#4828](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4828): The `dart.customDevTools` setting now running DevTools from source now works on Windows (this setting is intended for contributors to DevTools to allow testing it embedded).
- [#4827](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4827): The `dart.customDevTools` setting now uses `devtools_tool serve` instead of the legacy `build_e2e` script.

## Debugger

- [#4543](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4543): The new SDK debug adapters are now enabled for all users on recent Dart and Flutter SDKs.
