# v2.18.0 *2018-08-31*

## Debugger Improvements

- It's now possible to set environment variables via a `launch.json` property (`env`) for debug sessions
- Support for VS Code's new `terminateRequest` call has been added to allow graceful debugger shutdowns and reduce the chance of orphaned processes
- The working directory will now be set more reliable when using a relative path in a `launch.json`'s `program` property
- Arrays are once again sorted numerically in Variables and Watch windows
- Asserts are now enabled by default for VM projects and can be controlled with the `enableAsserts` property in `launch.json`
- The `Inspect Widget` command will now jump to the correct location (user code, not framework code) on Windows

## Test Runner Improvements

- Files are now only considered tests if they are in the root `test/` folder or end with `_test.dart`
- Running a single test file and then the **Dart: Run all tests** command will no longer result in duplicate test nodes in the tree
- Suite icons in the tree should no longer disappear if you stop a test run mid-execution
- Test results from previous test runs will now be faded out to make it clearer which results are from the most recent run
- Test files that fail to produce any results will no longer leave a "loading..." node in the tree

## Editor Improvements

- Quick-fixes that create files (eg. `Create file` on an import that doesn't exist) are now supported
- Dart snippets now work with VS Code's `editor.tabCompletion` feature which allows pressing `<tab>` to complete snippets even when the completion list is not open
- The code completion list will no longer consider the `(â€¦)` characters when filtering as you type

## Other Improvements

- Dart SDK update checks will no run for Dart SDKs being used from a Flutter SDK even if being used in a non-Flutter project
- Log files capture with the **Dart: Capture Logs** command will now include the VS Code version number at the top
- The Dart SDK update notification now has a "Disable update checks" button that will disable updating checking (this sets the `dart.checkForSdkUpdates` setting)
- Running pub/flutter commands from within the editor will print the correct folder name in the output instead of sometimes strings like `../..`
