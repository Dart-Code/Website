# v3.48.1 *2022-09-05*

- [#4139](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4139): The **Flutter: Hot Reload** and **Flutter: Hot Restart** commands are no longer missing (and with them, reload-on-save functionality) when running without debugging if using the new SDK DAPs.

# v3.48.0 *2022-09-01*

## Folder Renames

[#2483](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2483): When using Flutter 3.3 / Dart 2.18, moving or renaming a single folder will now update `import` statements the same way renaming a single file will. Renaming/moving multiple files/folders at once is not currently supported.

## Flutter

- [#3015](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3015): The "Wrap with widget" refactor now sets the selection to `widget` ready to type a widget class name.
- [#4061](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4061): The other "Wrap with ..." refactors now set the caret position to the opening paren rather than the closing paren (which may be many lines below).

## Debugger

- [#4074](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4074): Adding breakpoints in files that will not be hit because of debugger settings will now show a prompt even if debugger settings have previously been customised.

## New Debug Adapters for Dart and Flutter

New debug adapters (which provide the interface for VS Code to communicate with a running Dart/Flutter app) are available when using Flutter 3.3 / Dart 2.18. These new adapters are written in Dart provide some bug fixes and performance improvements over the original Dart-Code TypeScript adapters and will be easier to maintain/fix going forwards.

Users will be switched to the new adapters gradually over the coming releases, but they can be explicitly enabled/disabled by setting the `dart.previewSdkDaps` setting to `true` (opt-in) or `false` (opt-out). If not set (`undefined`), the extension will decide when to enable the new adapters.

Some initial improvements in the new adapters:

- [#4066](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4066): Running a Flutter app using "Run"/"Run without Debugging" no longer requires an active connection to the VM Service on the device running the app.
- [#3551](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3551): Breakpoints set in Dart SDK libraries by navigating with Go-to-Definition are now supported for Dart applications (not yet for Flutter apps).
- [#3522](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3522): Stepping through Dart SDK files when debugging Dart apps no longer opens duplicate copies of the SDK libraries (not yet for Flutter apps).
- [#3921](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3921): Detaching from an attached Flutter process will remove breakpoints and automatically resume.

If you notice any unexpected differences when using the new SDK DAPs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/new). You can tell whether you're using the new SDK DAPs by using the [Capture Debugging Logs command](https://dartcode.org/docs/logging/#capture-debugging-logs) before launching your app and checking whether the log contains "Running SDK DAP" instead of "Running debugger via node".

## Editor

- [#4112](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4112): The "You are modifying a file outside of your open folders" warning will no longer appear for non-Dart files.
- [#4097](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4097): The `dart.useLsp` setting has been replaced by `dart.useLegacyAnalyzerProtocol` and its meaning inverted. This setting will be removed in a future version. If you find that you need to enable use of the legacy protocol, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/new) detailing why.

## Testing

- [#4125](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4125): Tests with more than one newline in their names will no longer fail to run from CodeLens links.

## Other

- [#4110](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4110): The `dart.runPubGetOnPubspecChanges` setting has changed from a boolean to support "always", "prompt", "never". The new "prompt" setting will force a prompt to be shown when pubspec changes before fetching new packages.
- [#4080](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4080): The `dart.customDevToolsUri` setting added in the previous release has been replaced with a new `dart.customDevTools` which can launch a local development version of DevTools itself to aid debugging the embedded view if contributing to DevTools. Using this setting is documented in the [DevTools contribution guide](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-vs-code-integration).

## Documentation

- [#4126](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4126): Docs detailing all available [launch configuration options](https://dartcode.org/docs/launch-configuration/) have been updated to include `templateFor`.

## Features Enabled with Flutter 3.3 / Dart 2.18

Many features and fixes that previously required using pre-release versions of Dart/Flutter are now available after upgrading to stable Flutter 3.3 and/or Dart 2.18 SDKs.

- [#3934](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3934): The ordering of diagnostics will now remain stable during typing (where the specific diagnostics do not change) to avoid VS Code's Peek Error (`F8`) functionality from changing the selected error during typing.
- [#3929](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3929): Opening loose `.dart` files that are not part of a project (with a `pubspec.yaml` or `analysis_options.yaml`) will no longer sometimes cause some "File is not being analyzed" errors during startup.
- [#3906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3906): Code completion for the named argument `children: []` will no longer insert `[]` if completion is invoked on the `children` label and a value is already present.
- [#3892](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3892): Accepting code completion suggestions should no longer sometimes delete additional characters when the system is under load/slow.
- [#3833](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3833): Go to Type Definition allows navigating to the definition of a type of a symbol without first needing to navigate to the symbols definition.
- [#3952](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3952): Using `source.fixAll` in `editor.codeActionsOnSave` is no longer very slow (despite the command being very fast when run on its own).
- [#3975](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3975): Flutter Widget snippets now include `return Container()` as a placeholder `build` method.
- [#3981](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3981): "Add curly braces" now shows as a Quick-fix for the `always_put_control_body_on_new_line` lint.
- [#3970](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3970): Ctrl+Click/Go-to-Definition now works on filenames in "part of" directives.
- [#3950](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3950): Code Actions such as **Dart: Sort Members** and **Organize Imports** will now fail silently if configured to run on-save (via `editor.codeActionsOnSave`) and show errors if invoked manually.
- [#4020](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4020): Ctrl+Click on constructor declarations now automatically searches for references (depending on VS Code settings) as it already did for other types of declarations.
- [#4017](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4017): The `fun` snippet to create functions has been restored.
- [#4000](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4000): The **Dart: Convert Method to Getter** and **Dart: Convert Getter to Method** refactors will no longer show up in locations where they are not valid (and would error if selected).
- [#4029](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4029): The **Dart: Extract Method** refactor no longer shows up for import prefixes.
- [#4027](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4027): Code completion will no longer sometimes insert a literal `(...)` instead of parameter placeholders.
- [#3943](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3943): Code completion for symbols that start with `$` that are not yet imported will no longer insert duplicate `$`s when selected.
- [#3945](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3945): Error messages shown when trying to launch DevTools for a build that does not support it have been improved.
- [#4039](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4039): When using SDK debug adapters (via the `"dart.previewSdkDaps"` setting or automatic opt-in described above), exception popups now include the full exception text (matching the existing debug adapters).
- [#4053](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4053): The **Extract Method** refactor no longer incorrectly adds the `async` keyword to synchronous code that contained asynchronous callbacks.
- [#4031](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4031): Several issues with **Go to Definition** not navigating correctly on `super`/`this` formal params have been resolved.
