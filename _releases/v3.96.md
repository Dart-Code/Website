# v3.96.0 _2024-09-02_

## Editor

- [#5086](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5086): Documentation for lint rules now shows up in code completion for lint names in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- [#5100](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5100): The prompt to run `dart fix` now offers to run the **Dart: Fix All in Workspace** commands instead of recommending running `dart fix` from the terminal. See the [previous release notes](/releases/#fix-all-in-workspace-commands) for more details on the in-editor fix commands.
- [#5218](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5218): An issue with the **Move to File** refactoring causing an invalidate state after creating new files has been resolved.
- [#5207](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5207): The TextMate grammar used for initial syntax highlighting has been updated to handle the proposed [digit separators feature](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/2).
- [#5213](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5213): A new setting `dart.enablePub` allows disabling Pub functionality including prompts for `pub get`, automatically running `pub get` and visibility of the menu and command entries for running Pub commands.

## Flutter

- [#5231](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5231)/[#5226](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5226): The version file from `bin/cache/flutter.version.json` in the Flutter SDK is now used in preference to the legacy `version` file which fixes some issues when using the Flutter `master` branch that could result in failure to detect the version (and therefore disabling all features that require a certain SDK version, or causing some DevTools pages to fail to load).

## DevTools

- [#4558](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4558): Third party DevTools extensions (such as the one in `package:provider`) can be launched from the Flutter sidebar and work embedded inside VS Code.

## Flutter Sidebar

- [#5225](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5225): When using the latest versions of Flutter (currently only `master`), the Flutter sidebar will use DTD for communication with Dart-Code instead of `postMessage`. There are currently no functional differences between the two sidebars, but this is a step towards making [the APIs used by the sidebar](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/dtd_impl/dtd_common_services_editor.md) available to other DTD clients, and the sidebar more generic so that it could be used by editors besides VS Code.

## Debugger

- [#4734](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4734): Breakpoints are now eagerly resolved and should turn red (if valid) once the app is running, rather than remaining gray (unverified) until the first time the function is executed.
- [#5237](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5237): Global Evaluation no longer sometimes fails with "Unable to find the library" when using Windows but running your app on another platform device such as Android.
- [#5232](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5232): Automatic debug configurations that show up in the **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** list now include the project name as well as the workspace folder name.
- [#4481](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4481): The debug adapter now uses new `readyToResume` APIs to work better when there are other debuggers also connected. As long as the other debuggers also use these APIs, race conditions that could result in breakpoints being missed during Hot Reload / Hot Restart should be prevented.

## Testing

- [#5224](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5224): The overflow menu on the Test sidebar now has an option to jump to the settings for adding additional test arguments.
- [#4198](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4198): A whole folder of tests can now be run from the context menu in the Explorer sidebar.

## Docs / website

- [#5243](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5243): The link to the debug adapter documentation in the [launch configuration docs](https://dartcode.org/docs/launch-configuration/) has been updated and is no longer a 404.

## Misc

- [#5210](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5210): Permissions errors trying to read files through DTD due to differences in URI encoding of workspace roots have been resolved.
