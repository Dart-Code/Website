# v3.17.1 *2020-12-10*

- [#3001](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3001): Using bleeding-edge analysis server code built with v3.16 of the LSP spec no longer reports "Invalid params for initialize: params.capabilities.textDocument.rename.prepareSupportDefaultBehavior must be of type PrepareSupportDefaultBehavior".

# v3.17.0 *2020-12-04*

## LSP Improvements

Many enhancements have been made when running with the [LSP Preview](/releases/v3-16/#language-server-protocol-preview). Many of these rely on changes in the Dart language server so may not be immediately available depending on the Dart/Flutter channel you are using. At the time of writing, they have not yet reached the Flutter stable channel.

### [LSP] Apply-all Fixes

[#2926](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2926): Some quick-fixes are now able to be fixed for the entire file in one go.

### [LSP] Complete Function Calls

[#2823](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2823): A new setting `dart.completeFunctionCalls` will cause code completion on functions/methods to include parentheses and argument placeholders for required arguments.

### [LSP] Format Selection

[#812](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/812)/[#2790](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2790): It's now possible to format only a selection of code (or also [only lines modified according to source control](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/44075)).

### [LSP] `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` Code Completion

[#114](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/114)/[#2110](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2110): Basic code completion is now available for `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` files. This includes static identifiers and also lint names. It does not include Pub package names.

## Editor

- [#1626](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1626): Formatting files over 100k in size will no longer result in selections and breakpoints losing their positions.
- [#1590](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1590): The Dependencies tree now starts from package roots rather than the `lib` folder, simplifying opening files outside of the `lib` in dependencies.
- [#2964](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2964): The `dart.analysisExcludedFolders` setting is now also used to exclude projects from project detection and project selection inputs. This means an excluded Flutter project will not force a workspace into using a Flutter SDK if all other projects are only Dart.
- [#2740](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2740): A new command **Dart: Linkify Selected Text** will print the selected text to the terminal with `package:` links/filenames linkified. This is useful if you have a text stack trace (eg. in a log file) that you'd like to quickly linkify to be able to navigate.
- [#2960](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2960): [LSP] Duplicate code actions no longer appear in the lightbulb menu when two diagnostics have similar fixes on the same line.
- [#2945](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2945): [LSP] Enum members now use the EnumMember SymbolKind.
- [#2653](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2653): [LSP] The range of code shown when holding Cmd/Ctrl while hovering a symbol should now more accurately reflect the actual code range.

## Flutter

- [#2723](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2723)/[#2718](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2718): VS Code tasks are now contributed for additional commands like `flutter install` and `flutter build` and can be customized by copying to `tasks.json` using the Cog icon in the **Tasks: Run Task** picker.
- [#2958](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2958): The error shown when Flutter fails to initialize now includes a **Show Log** button.
- [#2929](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2929)/[#2935](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2935): The `dart.flutterAndroidX` setting has been removed. This support has been enabled by default for some time.

## Debugger

- [#2933](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2933): Debugger stack traces are now fetched in batches of 20 frames to improve performance.
- [#2970](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2970)/[#2971](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2971): A new setting `dart.hotReloadProgress` controls whether Hot Reload and Hot Restart progress is reported in the status bar or as a large notification (defaults to notification).
- [#2950](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2950)/[#2956](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2956): Dart tests will be run with `dart run test:test` when using a Dart SDK >= v2.12.
- [#2910](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2910): Large stack traces in the debug console are no longer excluded from linkifying.
- [#2783](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2783)/[#2954](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2954): Debug Adapters now require fewer variables be passed to `launchRequest`, simplifying their use by other editors.

## Testing

- [#2934](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2934): The Test tree should no longer show duplicate nodes after running tests many times concurrently.
- [#2915](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2915)/[#2916](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2916): [@bencehornak](https://github.com/bencehornak) contributed a new `dart.flutterTestAdditionalArgs` setting that allows injecting arguments to call invocations of `flutter test` (eg. to always run with `--coverage`).

## Commands

- [#2944](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2944): Fetching packages now uses `dart pub get` instead of `pub get` for Dart SDKs >= 2.12.
- [#2931](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2931): DevTools can now be opened in an external browser from the status bar even if it is already open in an embedded view.

## Other

- [#2930](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2930): [@timsneath](https://github.com/timsneath) Contributed improved descriptions for all settings and added links to docs where appropriate.
- [#2917](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2917): The extension no longer fails to activate if there are folders in your workspace that cannot be read due to permissions errors.
- [#2919](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2919): Dart-Code extension code is no longer minified, improving the locations reported in unhandled errors in its own code.
- [#2928](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2928): "MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected" leak no longer occurs after multiple silent extension restarts.
- [#2927](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2927): "Cannot read property 'dispose' of undefined" no longer occurs when reloading after an SDK-not-found error.

## Tasks

- [#2923](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2923): `build_runner` tasks now work reliably if run from the recent tasks list.
- [#2921](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2921): The `previewBuildRunnerTasks` preview flag has been removed and `build_runner` tasks are now always available..
- [#1284](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1284): Errors from `build_runner` tasks are now handled more reliably and will produce diagnostics in the Problems pane.
