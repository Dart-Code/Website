# v3.20.1 *2021-03-??*

## Editor

Some of these items also involved changes to the LSP language server, and may only show up with an updated Dart/Flutter SDK.

- [#3214](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3214): LSP code actions that insert new text using "snippets" no longer insert the wrong indentation.
- [#3203](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3203): Pressing enter on a line that contains a `//` comment now auto-inserts `//` on the next line, matching the existing behaviour for `///` comments.
- [#3196](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3196): Flutter gutter icons now shop up for expressions that use conditionals `expr ? widget1 : widget2`.
- [#3177](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3177): The `dart.autoImportCompletions` setting is now supported by LSP, allowing auto-import completions to be disabled.
- [#3170](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3170): Code completion no longer incorrectly triggers in comments at very end of a file.
- [#3160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3160): Code completion no longer sometimes returns stale results based on the version of a file first opened in the session.
- [#3159](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3159): Renaming a variable to match the name of a constructor called in the same scope no longer returns a confusing error message.
- [#3143](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3143)/[#3215](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3215): The "Wrap with widget" action now correctly selects the text "widget" when LSP is enabled.
- [#2873](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2873): Performance of Ctrl+Clicking symbols when LSP is enabled has been improved.
- [#101](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/101): Code completion is now able to suggest package names in the `dependencies` and `dev_dependencies` sections of `pubspec.yaml`.

## Commands

- [#3216](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3216): New commands `Pub: Upgrade Packages --major-versions` and `Flutter: Upgrade Packages --major-versions` will upgrade packages with [the --major-versions flag](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-upgrade#--major-versions) that updates constraints in `pubspec.yaml`.
- [#3213](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3213): Output panes no disappear then reappear (causing a visible flicker) when running new commands.
- [#3212](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3212): The `Flutter: Screenshot` command now works as expected with the latest versions of Flutter.


## Testing

- [#3151](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3151)/[#3157](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3157): The "Run Skipped" commands/buttons added in the previous version now also work for Flutter tests when using a new enough Flutter SDK (note: this does not include stable at the time of the release).
- [#3098](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3098): Test Discovery no longer sometimes inserts additional unknown test nodes into the tree if you open the test file immediately after starting a test run.

## Debugger

- [#3224](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3224): Fields now correctly show in debug tooltips when `evaluateGettersInDebugViews` is set to `false` (only getters are excluded).
- [#3210](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3210): Widgets in local (`path`) packages are now shown correctly in the DevTools inspector summary tree.
- [#3198](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3198): The DevTools server address is no longer passed multiple times with `--devtools-server-address` when launching Flutter apps.
- [#3195](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3195): Attaching to Dart or Flutter apps now correctly shows the `stdout` stream in the Debug Console.
- [#3188](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3188): The editors run/debug title buttons have been moved to the new VS Code `editor/title/run` menu, allowing them to apear before other buttons and overflow better.
- [#3187](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3187): Frames that cannot be restarted from (the top frame, and frames after any async boundary) now show the button disabled instead of reporting an error if clicked.

## Flutter

- [#3217](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3217): A new setting `dart.flutterShowWebServerDevice` allows enabling the web-server device even when running locally. Using the web-server device requires the Dart Debug extension and the Chrome device is still the recommended way for local development.
