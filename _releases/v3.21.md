# v3.21.1 *2021-03-31*

- [#3245](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3245): A bug in the change for [#3203](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3203) that caused only double-slashes `//` to be included after a triple-slash `///` comment has been fixed.

# v3.21.0 *2021-03-31*

## Editor

_Many of these editor changes rely on changes in the Dart/Flutter SDKs so may not be immediately visible depending on your Dart/Flutter SDK channel._

- [#3143](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3143)/[#3215](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3215): The "Wrap with widget" action now correctly pre-selects the text "widget" when LSP is enabled.
- [#3214](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3214): LSP code actions that insert multiline text using "snippets" now indent correctly.
- [#3203](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3203): Pressing `<enter>` on a comment line (starting with `//`) now auto-inserts `//` on the next line, matching the existing behaviour for triple-slash `///` comments.
- [#3177](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3177): The `dart.autoImportCompletions` setting is now supported by LSP, allowing auto-import completions to be disabled.
- [#3159](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3159): Renaming a variable to match the name of a constructor called in the same scope no longer returns a confusing error message about shadowing variables.
- [#3170](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3170): Code completion no longer incorrectly triggers in comments at very end of a file.
- [#3160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3160): Code completion no longer sometimes returns stale results based on the version of a file first opened in the session.
- [#2873](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2873): The performance of Ctrl+Clicking symbols when LSP is enabled has been improved.
- [#101](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/101): Code completion is now able to suggest package names in the `dependencies` and `dev_dependencies` sections of `pubspec.yaml`.

## Commands

- [#3216](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3216): New commands **Pub: Upgrade Packages --major-versions** and **Flutter: Upgrade Packages --major-versions** will upgrade packages using Pub's [`--major-versions` flag](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-upgrade#--major-versions) that updates constraints in `pubspec.yaml`.
- [#3213](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3213): Output panes no longer disappear then reappear (causing a visible flicker) when running new commands.
- [#3212](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3212): The **Flutter: Screenshot** command works again with the latest versions of Flutter.
- [#3237](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3237): Clicking the **Get Packages** button in the editors menu bar for a Dart project's `pubspec.yaml` in a workspace that also contains a Flutter project will no longer run `flutter pub get` instead of `pub get`.
- [#3179](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3179)/[#3238](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3238): The **Dart: New Project** command now uses `dart create` instead of Stagehand for Dart SDK versions >= v2.10.0.

## Testing

- [#3151](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3151)/[#3157](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3157): The **Run Skipped** commands/buttons added in the previous version now also work for Flutter tests when using a new enough Flutter SDK (this does not include stable at the time of the release).
- [#3098](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3098): Test Discovery no longer sometimes inserts additional unknown test nodes into the tree if you open the test file immediately after starting a test run.

## Debugger

- [#3224](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3224): Fields now correctly show in debug tooltips when `evaluateGettersInDebugViews` is set to `false` (only getters are excluded).
- [#3210](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3210): Widgets in local (`path`) packages are now shown correctly in the DevTools inspector summary tree.
- [#3198](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3198): The DevTools server address is no longer passed multiple times with `--devtools-server-address` when launching Flutter apps.
- [#3195](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3195): Attaching to Dart or Flutter apps now correctly shows the `stdout` stream in the Debug Console.
- [#3188](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3188): The editors run/debug title buttons have been moved to the new VS Code `editor/title/run` menu, allowing them to appear before other buttons and overflow better.
- [#3187](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3187): Frames that cannot be restarted from (the top frame, and frames after an async boundary) now show the button disabled instead of reporting an error if clicked.

## Flutter

- [#3196](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3196): Flutter gutter icons now work for expressions that use conditionals `expr ? widget1 : widget2`.
- [#3217](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3217): A new setting `dart.flutterShowWebServerDevice` allows enabling the web-server device even when running locally. Using the web-server device requires the Dart Debug extension and the Chrome device is still the recommended way for non-remote development.
