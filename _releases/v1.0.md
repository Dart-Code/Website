# v1.0.2

- `interface` has been removed from the list of keywords for syntax highlighting. It has not been a Dart keyword for sometime and resulted in incorrect coloring when using it as a variable name
- Expressions in interpolated strings should now be highlighted even when containing properties and method calls

---

# v1.0.1

- Opening a Dart file from the Dart SDK (such as navigating via `Go to Definition` on an SDK type) when using a dev-version 1.23 Dart SDK will no longer result in an infinite analyzing loop causing `Analyzing...` to flicker on the status bar

---

# v1.0.0

- Pressing F5 to launch Dart programs after upgrading to Code 1.10 will no longer fail with an error about an unexpected token in `launch.json`
- Pressing F5 to launch Dart programs will now use Dart's `checked mode` by default
- A new setting has been introduced (`pubAdditionalArgs`) that allows additional arguments to be passed to `pub` in the `Pub Get` and `Pub Upgrade` commands (this may be useful if you wish to use `--packages-dir`)
- The order of items in error reports have been tweaked slightly to move more useful stuff further up
