# v2.15.0

## Test Runner

A new test runner has been added that will render test results in a tree in the Test section of the Side Bar.

Currently there is no detection of tests so they will only appear once you start running them which can be done with `F5`/`launch.json`, using the `Start Debugging`/`Start Without Debugging` options on explorer context menus or using the new `Run All Tests` command noted below to run multiple files at once.

Clicking on a test will open the `Output` pane if there is any output from the test and also navigate you to the test in the source (note: navigating to the source required a change in Flutter which is currently only available on the `master` channel).

Note: By default this is only enabled for Flutter projects but you can opt-in for Dart projects by setting the `dart.previewTestRunnerForDart` setting to `true`.

## Run All Tests

A new command has been added to quickly run all tests in your project (the equivilent of `flutter test` or `pub run test`). This command will spawn a session for each workspace folder that contains tests and run them concurrently.

## Go To Implementation

[Go To Implementation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-implementation) has been implemented to allow you to quickly jump to implementations from abstract members/interfaces.

## Quickly Open in Android Studio or Xcode

New context menu entries have been added to `ios` and `android` folders to allow you to quickly open them in Xcode or Android Studio.

## Filtered Extension Logging

The `Capture Logs` command has been extended to allow selection of which log categories to include when troubleshooting or reporting issues in the extension. All categories are shown by default and some are always included and therefore not included in the picklist.

## Other Changes

- Handling of concurrent Dart or Flutter debug sessions has been improved and commands that work on a specific debug session (for example `Open Observatory`) will now prompt you to select a session
- `throw`ing plain instances like `String`s will now show correct values in the `Variables > Exceptions` debugger pane instead of only the fields of the instance
- Evaluating expressions in the Watch pane will now time out after 1 second to avoid hanging when no response is received
- Launching debug sessions from multi-root workspaces where there are no `launch.json` files has been made more reliable
- `Copy Value` in the Variables and Watch debugger panes should no longer truncate the values added to the clipboard
- Additional instances of exception messages being truncated in the debugger have been resolved
- Log files created using the `Dart: Capture Logs` command will now be prefixed with some information about the SDKs that have been loaded
- Workspace symbols are now given more accurate ranges
