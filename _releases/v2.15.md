# v2.15.0 *2018-06-29*

## Test Runner

A new test runner has been added that will render test results in a tree in the Test Side Bar.

Currently there is no detection of tests so they will only appear once you start running them which can be done with `F5`/`launch.json`, using the `Start Debugging`/`Start Without Debugging` options on explorer context menus or using the new `Run All Tests` command (noted below) to run all test files.

Clicking on a test will open the `Output` pane if there is any output from the test and also navigate you to the test in the source (note: navigating to the source required a change in Flutter which is currently only available on the `master` channel).

Note: By default this is only enabled for Flutter projects. You can opt-in for Dart projects by setting the `dart.previewTestRunnerForDart` setting to `true` though there may be some edge cases where this currently does not work correctly.

## Run All Tests

A new command has been added to quickly run all tests in your project (the equivilent of `flutter test` or `pub run test`). This command will spawn a concurrent debug session for each workspace folder that contains tests.

## Go To Implementation

[Go To Implementation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-implementation) has been implemented to allow you to quickly jump to implementations from abstract members/interfaces.

## Quickly Open in Android Studio or Xcode

New context menu entries have been added to `ios` and `android` folders to allow you to quickly open them in Xcode or Android Studio.

## Filtered Extension Logging

The `Capture Logs` command has been extended to allow selection of which log categories to include when troubleshooting or reporting issues in the extension.

## Other Changes

- Handling of concurrent Dart or Flutter debug sessions has been improved and commands that work on a specific debug session (for example `Open Observatory`) will now prompt you to select a session
- `throw`ing plain instances like `String`s will now show correct values in the `Variables > Exceptions` debugger pane instead of only the fields of the instance
- Evaluating expressions in the Watch pane will now time out after 1 second to avoid hanging when no response is received
- Launching debug sessions from multi-root workspaces where there are no `launch.json` files has been made more reliable
- `Copy Value` in the Variables and Watch debugger panes should no longer truncate the values added to the clipboard
- Additional instances of exception messages being truncated in the debugger have been resolved
- Log files created using the `Dart: Capture Logs` command will now be prefixed with some information about the SDKs that have been loaded
- Workspace symbols are now assigned more accurate ranges
- Refactors that edit multiple files are less likely to record multiple undo steps
