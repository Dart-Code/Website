# v3.100.0 _2024-10-31_

## Deprecation of Support for Older SDK Versions

[#5257](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5257)/[#5304](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5304): As [previously announced](https://groups.google.com/g/flutter-announce/c/JQHzM3FbBGI), support for older Dart/Flutter SDKs will be deprecated with Dart 3.6 and removed when Dart 3.7 releases next year. If you are using an affected SDK version (a Dart SDK before Dart 3.0 or a Flutter SDK before Flutter 3.10) you will see a notification.

It is recommended to upgrade to at least Dart 3.0 / Flutter 3.10 (released May 2023) before then, but a table showing which extension versions support which SDKs (and instructions on how to change extension version) is available on the [SDK Compatibility page](/sdk-version-compatibility/) if you need to use these versions after then.

## DevTools

- [#4971](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4971)/[#5297](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5297): VS Code theme changes are now pushed to DevTools realtime allowing it to update without a reload. This requires an equivalent change in DevTools which is included in the next SDK release.
- [#5311](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5311): Using the `dart.customDevTools` setting to run DevTools from source now assumes the tool is named `dt` instead of the original name `devtools_tool`.

## Testing

- [#5303](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5303): An error ("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'endsWith')") that could prevent tests from being added to the Test Explorer has been resolved.

## Dependencies Tree

- [#5307](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5307): The Dependencies tree no longer fails to show any nodes if the folder name and the package name in `pubspec.yaml` do not match.

## Documentation / Website

- [#5300](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5300): Fix a typo the "Line Length" setting description.
- [#4665](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4665)/[#5312](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5312): A [new page](/docs/sdk-locating/) was added to the site detailing how the extension locates an SDK to use during startup.

## Misc

- [#5321](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5321): The temporary allowlist for allowing Pub packages to recommend their VS Code extensions has been removed.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#4934](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4934): The **Dart: Sort Members** command will now honor the `sort_constructors_first` lint.
- [#5294](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5294): Placing the caret in the name of a field in a record no longer causes VS Code to highlight all instances of that name in the document using a basic text search.
- [#5269](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5269): Renaming files (or creating new files whose paths are already imported) should no longer result in stale `uri_does_not_exist` diagnostics after the file exists.
- [#5235](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5235): The **Move To File** refactor now shows "Refactoringâ€¦" status notifications in the status bar, matching other kinds of refactors.
- [#5157](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5157): Breakpoints no longer jump to different lines if the location where they were added is not valid. Instead, they will remain grey/unresolved.
