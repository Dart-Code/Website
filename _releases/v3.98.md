## Editor

[#3628](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3628)/[#5263](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5263): [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed new settings for customizing the prefix and font style of Closing Labels.

- [#5253](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5253): The `codeLens.path` field for launch configurations now supports wildcards, allowing more control over which files custom CodeLenses appear in.
- [#5265](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5265): Closing labels now show and update for all visible editors, not only the active editor.
- [#5270](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5270): The diagnostic for the `file_names` lint now includes additional information about resolving the issue after renaming a file by only case.

## Debugger

- [#5283](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5283): The "Build errors exist in your project" dialog has been updated to no longer refer to errors as "Build errors" and uses "Run Anyway" instead of "Debug Anyway" because it can also apply to running without debugging.

## Dependencies Tree

Various improvements have been made to the Dependencies Tree.

- [#5281](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5281): The Dependencies tree no longer sometimes fails to group dependencies by Direct, Dev, transitive when in a non-Flutter workspace but a Flutter SDK is available.
- [#5288](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5288): The Dependencies tree no longer triggers `pub deps` (which can create a `.dart_tool` folder) for workspaces where Pub has been disabled.
- [#5287](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5287): Nested packages in the Dependencies tree are now shown with (and sorted by) their relative paths from their workspace folders to make finding nodes in large workspaces easier.
- [#5286](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5286): Analysis and project exclusions from `analysis_options.yaml` like `foo/**` no longer incorrectly exclude the folder `foo/`.
- [#5260](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5260): The dependencies tree now properly supports the upcoming [Pub Workspaces](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/4127) feature.

## Misc

- [#5272](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5272): When a background process like the analyzer or Flutter daemon terminates, the "Open Log" button on the prompt will no open the specific log for that process (if enabled) instead of a generic log of all events from all processes.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5271](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5271): The URI for the Dart Tooling Daemon provided to DevTools is now correctly exposed/tunnelled for remote workspaces and passed to the DevTools server. This fixes some (but not all) issues with using the Sidebar and/or DevTools in web based IDEs.
- [#5247](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5247): Annotations on super parameters (`@annotation super.x`) are now correctly coloured, just like field formals are (`@annotation this.x`).
- [#5289](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5289): Color previews (and the color picker) are available again on the latest Flutter `master` branch.
- [#5284](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5284): Dartdoc `@template` macros declared on members of extensions and extension types are now supported.
- [#5268](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5268): Output from Flutter's `stderror` is now correctly decoded when captured using **Dart: Capture Debugging Logs** command.
- [#5254](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5254): Extension members are no longer duplicated in code completion for all imported libraries in which they are available.
- [#5242](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5242): Prefixed identifiers are no longer hidden from code completion just because the same name is in-scope without a prefix.
