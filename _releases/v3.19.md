# v3.19.0 *2020-01-29*

## Test Runner

- [#3097](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3097)/[#3101](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3101): Explicitly running a single skipped test from the test tree or CodeLens links will now ignore the skipped flag and always run.
- [#3048](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3048)/[#3090](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3090): A new command: **Run Skipped Tests** has been added that functions similar to **Run Failed Tests**, but runs only tests marked as skipped.
- [#3060](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3060)/[#3100](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3100): The **Run/Debug Failed** context menu items and the new **Run/Debug Skipped** context menu items are now available on group nodes in the test tree in addition to suite notes.
- [#3093](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3093): Test suites should no longer be re-sorted during runs causing them to move around. If their status changes to failed, they will still be promoted to the top.
- [#3058](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3058): The "Run All Tests" command now correctly removes stale tests after completing (for example, tests that had been renamed).
- [#3052](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3052): Test Discovery should no longer result in duplicate nodes in the test tree on Windows.
- [#3038](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3038): Skipped tests can now be hidden from the test tree.
- [#3049](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3049)/[#3053](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3053): A new command **Clear Test Results** removes all test results from the test tree until they are next run/discovered.
- [#3050](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3050)/[#3084](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3084): New toolbar buttons and a menu have been added to the top of the test tree for running tests, clearing test results and for toggling visibility of hidden tests.
- [#3094](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3094): Test icons have been (slightly) updated.

## LSP Semantic Tokens

[#2202](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2202): LSP's Semantic Tokens are now supported by Dart Code. In order to use semantic tokens you need:

- Dart Code v3.19.0 or later
- To have the LSP Preview enabled (see the `dart.previewLsp` setting)
- A Dart SDK v2.12 or later or a Flutter SDK containing the same _(these changes are not in the stable channels at the time of the Dart Code release)_

Semantic tokens fix a number of inconsistencies in syntax highlighting that were not easily addressed using the original textmate grammar. Below is a screenshot comparing the original colouring (left) and new colouring (right).

Some specific issues this addresses:

- [#2241](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2241): Allow highlighting unknown/invalid types differently to known types.
- [#2237](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2237): Allow variables to be themed.
- [#1900](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1900): Allow changing the color of named parameter labels in themes.
- [#1688](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1688): Allow coloring different types of variables/fields differently in themes.
- [#311](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/311): Variable names starting with uppercase characters should not be coloured as types.
- [#2748](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2748): Methods named `get` or `set` are incorrectly colored as keywords.

## LSP Improvements

_Items marked "(requires SDK update)" rely on changes in the Dart/Flutter SDKs so may not be immediately visible depending on your Dart/Flutter SDK channel (these changes are not in the stable channels at the time of the Dart Code release)._

- [#2761](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2761): Imports are now updated when moving/renaming files when using LSP. This is currently only supported for single-file moves/renames (requires SDK update).
- [#3081](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3081): Flutter gutter icon previews no longer sometimes fail to render the first time you open a file.
- [#3079](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3079): Flutter UI Guides no longer sometimes fail to render the first time you open a file.
- [#2951](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2951): The "Extract Local Variable" refactor is now available for LSP (requires SDK update).
- [#2653](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2653): Holding `Cmd`/`Ctrl` when hovering over a symbol will now show the correct code preview in the hover popup.
- [#2896](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2896): Flutter icon previews now show up in completion and hovers for LSP.

## Flutter

- [#3045](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3045): The **Enable &lt;platform&gt;** entries in the device picker now show up for platforms for which there are available emulators, even if there are no active devices. For example, **Enable Android** will show up if your current project is missing its Android folder/dependencies if you have Android emulators, even if you have no active Android devices.
- [#3034](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3034): On Flutter's first run, when the **Initializing Flutter...** notification appears, output will be streamed to the output window to make it clearer what's happening and/or why it's taking a long time.
- [#3022](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3022): Platform-specific options are now hidden when that platform is disabled (for example with `flutter config --no-enable-android`).
- [#3020](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3020): If the Flutter SDK's `version` file changes while the analyzer is running, you'll now be prompted to restart it using the new SDK version.

## Editor

_Items marked "(requires SDK update)" rely on changes in the Dart/Flutter SDKs so may not be immediately visible depending on your Dart/Flutter SDK channel (these changes are not in the stable channels at the time of the Dart Code release)._

- [#2973](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2973): Code completion will no longer sometimes stop returning most results after running a Flutter app on Windows (requires SDK update).
- [#3067](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3067): Cupertino icon previews now show in code completion/hovers in addition to Material icons.
- [#3066](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3066): Icon variants (such as outlined, rounded) now correctly render previews.
- [#3030](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3030): Multi-line TODO comments are now supported when subsequent lines are indented by an extra space (requires SDK update).
- [#2800](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2800): Comments that span multiple lines can now be collapsed using code folding (requires SDK update).
- [#2982](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2982): Code completion no longer fails to suggest type names after the word `static` in class field definitions (requires SDK update).

## DevTools Integration

- [#3064](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3064): DevTools can now be started without an active debug session, allowing you to connect to an application not launched from VS Code.
- [#3063](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3063): The **Open DevTools** command is now listed in the **Flutter** category in addition to **Dart**.

_The following items rely on changes in the Flutter SDK and/or DevTools so may not be immediately visible depending on your Flutter SDK channel (these changes are not in the stable channels at the time of the Dart Code release)._

- [#3086](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3086): VS Code now shares its DevTools instance with Flutter to support deep linking.
- [#3088](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3088)/[#3087](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3087): Some types of Flutter widget errors (initially render overflow errors) will trigger warning notifications including a quick way to inspect the erroring widget.

## Debugger

- [#3033](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3033): Hot-reload-on-save no longer fires for Save events triggered by VS Code's auto-save feature. Pressing Save manually will still trigger a reload even if there are no unsaved changes.
- [#2974](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2974): The debuggers request for the top stack frame is now satisfied using the VM pauseEvent's topFrame, reducing latency when the debugger breaks; this is a performance optimisation that mostly affects web.

## Documentation

- [#3046](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3046): [@kagouda](https://github.com/kagouda) updated references to the **Flutter: New Project** command in docs to the new name **Flutter: New Application Project**.
- [#2824](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2824): The build_runner tasks have been added to the [Tasks page](https://dartcode.org/docs/tasks/#build_runner) with a link to build_runner documentation.
