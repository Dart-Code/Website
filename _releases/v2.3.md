# v2.3.5

- When working with a project that does not have trailing slashes on paths in the `.packages` file (such as dart-lang/sdk) breakpoints in packages should now work as expected.

---

# v2.3.4

- Go-to-Definition now works in read-only files (eg. SDK or external files opened using Go-to-Definition)

## New Preview Features available in this version

- [`dart.previewAnalyzeAngularTemplates`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/396) - Enables analysis for AngularDart templates (requires the [angular_analyzer_plugin](https://github.com/dart-lang/angular_analyzer_plugin))

---

# v2.3.3

- The dependency tree will now update after packages are changed/updated
- When opening a Fuchsia project, the explorer will no longer indefinitely show a progress bar caused by trying to read dependencies
- When using Go to Definition, files that are outside of your workspace root (eg. packages, SDK sources) will now be readonly to avoid accidental modification

---

# v2.3.2

- A new "Packages Tree" has been added to the explorer which lists your projects depencies and allows you to browse them in a read-only view
- The ability to switch SDKs has been removed for Flutter and Fuchsia projects where it does not make sense
- Fuchsia projects are now detected and will use the correct Dart SDK from Fuchsia
- The [`dart.previewFlutterCloseTagDecorations`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383) preview feature has had several improvements
  - Decorations now appear in Fuchsia projects as well as Flutter projects
  - Decorations now appear for any `Widget`-returning method instead of only methods named `build`
  - Decorations will update less frequently to avoid flickering during quick typing
  - Decorations should no longer appear in invalid places (probably)
  - Decorations now look more like comments, prefixed with `//` instead of `/`
  - Decorations now apply to `const` constructor calls as well as those using `new`

---

# v2.3.1

- An issue with searching symbols in a file being unreliable (appearing to hang) has been fixed
- A new setting `flutterHotReloadOnSave` has been added to force a hot reload upon saving (if there are no errors in the file being saved)
- A new `Full Restart` command is now available during Flutter debugging sessions for a full restart

## New Preview Features available in this version

- [`dart.previewFlutterCloseTagDecorations`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383) - Show annotations against Flutter widget constructor calls that span multiple lines

---

# v2.3.0 - Flutter Debugging Commands

Several new commands have been added to aid Flutter debugging. These appear in the command palette but can be bound to keys in the Keyboard Shortcuts window in Code.

- Toggle Debug Painting
- Toggle Performance Overlay
- Toggle Slow Animations
- Toggle Repaint Rainbow
- Toggle Platform (Android/iOS)
- Toggle Baseline Painting
- Toggle Slow-Mode Banner

Additionally the default hotkey for `Organize Directives` has been removed to avoid a warning from Code about modifier keys. You can rebind this command in Code's Keyboard Shortcuts window.
