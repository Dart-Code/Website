# v2.21.1 *2018-12-05*

- A regression introduced in v2.21.0 that resulted in a `Path must be a string` error when launching a debug session with no open files (and no output pane) visible has been fixed.

# v2.21.0 *2018-11-28*

## Preview: Prompt to Launch with Errors

A new setting `dart.previewPromptToRunIfErrors` has been added that will prompt you before launching if errors exist in your project.

This will become the default behaviour in future so please try it out and open issues if it fires when you would not expect.

## Improved Completion Icons for Folders/Files

Code completion for imports now shows file and folder icons from your VS Code theme.

## Run All Tests in Launch Config

It's now possible to create a launch config in `launch.json` that runs all tests (the same functionality as the **Dart: Run All Tests** command) by setting the `program` property to the path of a test folder. Unlike the command, this can be run with or without debugging (`F5` / `Ctrl`+`F5`) whereas the command always runs without the debugger.

```js
{
	"name": "All Tests",
	"type": "dart",
	"request": "launch",
	"program": "tests/", // or tests/foo for a subset of tests
}
```

## Other Changes

- The **Flutter: Save Screenshot** command now works when multiple devices are connected, taking the screenshot from the device selected in the status bar.
- Launch configs `cwd`s are now considered when detecting project entry points.
- A warning will be shown if a launch config contains a variable that cannot be resolved.
- The `deviceId` field now shows in completion for launch configs and will not generate a warning when used.
- The labels in the SDK picker have been moved around so that long paths are less likely to be truncated.
- Opening a `.code-workspace` file that contains paths that do not exist will no longer cause the extension to fail to activate.
- The warning `Unknown kind: MIXIN` when writing code using mixins will no longer be printed to the dev console.
- An incompatibility with the Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 extension that resulted in font ligatures not working correctly for `=>` has been resolved.
