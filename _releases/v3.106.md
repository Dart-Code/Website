# v3.106.0 _2025-03-03_

## Old SDK Support

[#5325](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5325): As [previously announced](https://groups.google.com/g/flutter-announce/c/JQHzM3FbBGI), support for Dart SDK v2.19 / Flutter SDK v3.7 and earlier has been removed in this version (v3.106) of the extension. If you need to use these older SDK versions you will need to install v3.104. The [SDK Compatibility page](/sdk-version-compatibility/) maintains a table of which extension versions support which SDKs.

## Editor

- [#5326](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5326): A new **Dart: Go to Imports** command has been added that allows jumping to the `import` directive(s) that provide a given symbol/identifier.
- [#5423](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5423): Debug Adapter traffic is no longer captured when using  the **Dart: Capture Analysis Server Logs** command.
- [#2470](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2470): The presence of an `analysis_options.yaml` inside a `lib/` folder no longer prevents auto-import code completions from working correctly.

## Debugger

- [#4727](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4727): Stack traces in the debug console now have clickable links for SDK `_patch.dart` files.
- [#4853](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4853): Compilation errors in the debug console now have clickable links to the related source.

## Testing

- [#5390](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5390): The bubble shown to summarize failed tests now shows both expected and actual values when both are simple one-line values.

## Flutter

- [#5411](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5411): Enabling a new device now automatically selects it after enabling.

## Misc

- [#5420](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5420): The **Open in Xcode** action no longer fails if Xcode is installed on a removable drive.
- [#5328](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5328): The error message shown when the analysis server crashes has been improved, including a **Show Log** button that shows the server output.
- [#5376](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5376): The error message shown when running the analysis server from source with a mismatched SDK version has been improved.

## DevTools

- [#5276](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5276)/[#5406](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5406): Embedded DevTools pages no longer try to adapt to the editor font size but instead follow the surrounding VS Code UI (including zoom scaling). This should result in more consistent font sizing.

## Dart Tooling Daemon

- [#5403](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5403): A new setting `dart.toolingDaemonAdditionalArgs` allows configuring additional arguments to pass to the Dart Tooling Daemon, for example to pass an explicit port with `--port`.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5421](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5421): `test`/`group` snippets now automatically add imports for `package:test/test.dart` or `package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart` if not already present.
- [#5387](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5387): Projects using Pub Workspaces will no longer fail to resolve breakpoints when running on the web.
- [#5314](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5314): Unresolved (greyed) breakpoints will now contain a tooltip indicating if they are just not yet resolved, or if they are unable to be resolved (for example because they are in an invalid location).
- [#5238](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5238): [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed a fix for auto-imports not adding to the `show` combinator of an existing import when selected.
- [#4454](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4454): `.new` references to the unnamed constructor are now highlighted correctly with other references to the same constructor (and the declaration).
- [#5426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5426): When debugging, floating values ("inline values") will be shown for the values of local variables and parameters in the current executing function.
- [#2785](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2785): Package names in `pubspec.yaml` have document links (can be Ctrl+Clicked) to open the relevant Pub.dev or GitHub pages in a browser.
