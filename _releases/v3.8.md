# v3.8.0 *2020-01-31*

## Flutter Interactive Code Samples CodeLens

[#2151](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2151)/[#2232](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2232): New in-line CodeLens links have been added to open the interactive code samples from Flutter widget definitions.

Clicking the CodeLens link will open the interactive sample from the API docs in your browser.

This functionality replaces the previous **Flutter: Open Widget Sample** command.

## Restart Frame

[#2171](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2171): The functionality included as [Step Back](/releases/v3-7/#preview-step-back) in the previous release has been moved to the call stack as **Restart Frame**. This allows jumping back to other frames than the immediate parent.

## Editor

- [#2131](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2131): The `dart.previewNewCompletionPlaceholders` functionality [added in the last release](/releases/v3-7/#preview-placeholders-for-required-arguments) is now enabled by default.
- [#2179](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2179): The **Open in Xcode** action now opens `Runner.xcworkspace` instead of (and falling back to) `Runner.xcodeproj`.
- [#2178](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2178): The **Open in Xcode** command now works even if the Xcode binary is named something other than `xcode`.
- [#2196](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2196): The Workspace Symbols list no longer shows filenames twice.
- [#2190](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2190): The **Analyzing...** status message is now hidden when the analyzer terminates.

## Debugger

- [#2184](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2184): Invalid `program` paths in `launch.json` will now show a more descriptive message when trying to run so it's clearer where/how to fix the issue.
- [#2165](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2165): The `${name}` placeholder used in log file names will now be substituted with the device name when Flutter projects without a `launch.json`.
- [#2164](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2164): When running a CLI script using the [terminal mode](/releases/v3-7/#run-dart-cli-apps-in-terminal), output buffering is disabled.

## Other

- [#2225](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2225)/[#2233](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2233): A warning will be shown if Flutter is installed in a protected folder on Windows that could prevent Flutter from functioning correctly.
- [#2162](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2162): Settings that contain log filenames/paths now use `machine-overridable` scope to prevent them being applied when connected to a remote workspace that may be a different platform.
- [#2143](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2143): The log file shown when the analysis server terminates now contains all log entries rather than just the **General** log category.
- [#1495](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1495): The **Dart: Open DevTools** command is now visible when not in a debug session and will show explanatory text if invoked.
- [#2157](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2157): CI builds have been migrated from Travis/AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.
