## Move Multiple Files/Folders

[#4533](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4533): With Dart v3.3 / Flutter v3.19 it's now possible to move multiple files/folders in a single action and have `import` statements updated automatically.

## Flutter

- [#4954](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4954): Improvements have been made to the built-in flow for downloading Flutter. The built-in Git extension will now be included when trying to locate `git` for cloning and error messages have been improved.

## Testing

- [#4924](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4924): A progress notification is now shown immediately when starting a debug session. This should make it clearer when test sessions are starting up until the point that the test starts (and the test icon updates).

## DevTools

- [#5000](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5000): A new **DevTools: Open DevTools in Web Browser** command is available in the command palette that always opens DevTools in an external browser regardless of embed settings.
- [#4997](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4997): When using the `dart.customDevTools` setting to run DevTools from source, errors starting DevTools are surfaced better.

## Dart Tooling Daemon

- [#4984](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4984)/[#4985](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4985)/[#5013](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5013)/[#5017](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5017)/[#5010](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5010): Support for the new [Dart Tooling Daemon](https://docs.flutter.dev/go/dart-tooling-daemon) has been added. This daemon is aimed at simplifying communication between Dart and Flutter tools (including [DevTools Extensions](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/tree/master/packages/devtools_extensions#readme)) in the future.

# Misc

- [#5001](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5001): Due to breaking changes in the code completion APIs, the `dart.useLegacyAnalyzerProtocol` setting is now ignored for Dart SDKs 3.3 and later. The LSP protocol will always be used for these newer SDKs.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5002](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5002): Pressing `F2` to rename a generic class with the class name selected or the cursor at the end of the class name no longer reports "The element can't be renamed".
- [#4995](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4995): Automatic `toString()` invocations in the debugger (controlled by the `dart.evaluateToStringInDebugViews` setting) now evaluate up to 100 values per request instead of 11.
- [#4877](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4877): The hover for `Enum.values` no longer incorrectly reports the type as `Enum` instead of `List<Enum>`.
- [#4730](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4730): The **Copy Value** action in the Watch window no longer copies truncated values.
- [#4780](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4780)/[#4931](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4931): For loops are now foldable.
- [#4723](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4723): Function expressions are now foldable.
