# Main Method CodeLens

[#2356](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2356)/[#2359](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2359)/[#2373](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2373) CodeLens links are now available on `main()` methods for both applications and test scripts. This allows running the current file even if the current launch configuration specifies another script. These links can be toggled using the `dart.showMainCodeLens` setting.

The `template` field in a launch config (see below for an example) has been extended to support templating these CodeLens.

- `run-test` applies to `test()` and `group()` CodeLens, runs without debugging
- `debug-test` applies to `test()` and `group()` CodeLens, runs with debugging
- `run-test-file` applies to `main()` CodeLens in test files, runs without debugging
- `debug-test-file` applies to `main()` CodeLens in test files, runs with debugging
- `run-file` applies to `main()` CodeLens in non-test files, runs without debugging
- `debug-file` applies to `main()` CodeLens in non-test files, runs with debugging

# Run Tests on Device

[#2363](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2363)/[#2374](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2374): A new launch config flag `runTestsOnDevice` has been added that allows you to create launch configurations that will run tests with `flutter run` on the select device instead of using `flutter test`.

Using the two features above together, you can add CodeLens links to easily run test scripts on a device:

```js
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Flutter App",
			"request": "launch",
			"type": "dart"
		},
		{
			"name": "Debug Tests on Device",
			"request": "launch",
			"type": "dart",
			"runTestsOnDevice": true,
			// This adds this config to CodeLens for test files
			"template": "debug-test-file"
		}
	]
}
```

# Pub: List Outdated Packages

[#2322](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2322)/[#2350](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2350): A new **Dart: List Outdated Packages** command has been added that runs `pub outdated`. It's also available on the context menu and editor toolbar for the `pubspec.yaml` file.

This command will only show up when using >= v2.8 of the Dart SDK.

# Custom Emulators

[#1553](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1553)/[#2360](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2360)/[#2319](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2319): It's now possible to add third party emulators that don't show up in `flutter emulators` to the device selector using the `dart.flutterCustomEmulators` setting. The emulator must still show up in `flutter devices` once it's been launched for it to be used to launch an app:

```js
"dart.flutterCustomEmulators": [
	{
		"id": "my-emu",
		"name": "My Emulator",
		"executable": "/path/to/emulator",
		"args": ["--launch"]
	}
]
```

This setting also allows the command/args used to launch existing Flutter emulators to be overriden by using the same ID. For example, to force an existing Android emulator with the ID `Pixel_2_XL_API_29` to run with `-gpu host` you can override its command/args:

```js
{
	"id": "Pixel_2_XL_API_29",
	"name": "Pixel 2",
	"executable": "/Users/danny/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator",
	"args": ["-avd", "Pixel_2_XL_API_29", "-gpu", "host"]
}
```

## Editor

- [#1991](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1991): Holding `<shift>` when accepting code completions will now always insert completion text (rather than replacing text immediately to the right of the cursor). Which mode is default can be controlled by setting the `editor.suggest.insertMode` for `[dart]` in your user settings.
- [#2387](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2387): Errors and lints will now have clickable error codes (where available) to open a web page containing more information about the error/lint.
- [#2169](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2169): Key-binding is now available for both fixes and refactors (see [refactorings and code fixes](https://dartcode.org/docs/refactorings-and-code-fixes/), though note that all IDs may not work unless you're using a very recent SDK version).
- [#956](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/956): Closing Labels will now appear/disappear more reliably when enabling/disabling without restarting the editor.
- [#2323](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2323): Symbols are no longer doubled in the workspace symbol list if `dart.additionalAnalyzerFileExtensions` includes `.dart` or duplicates.
- [#2378](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2378): The **Dart: Sort Members** command now works when the LSP preview is enabled.

## Debugger

- [#2146](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2146): `Maps` with complex keys (such as `DateTime`s) are now shown correctly in debug views like Watch and Variables.
- [#1990](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1990): The debugger `Copy value` action no longer adds `"` around string values.
- [#1246](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1246): Debug views will now automatically call `toString()` on complex types. This can be controlled with the `dart.evaluateToStringInDebugViews` setting.
- [#1021](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1021): The watch window will now show "not available" instead of an error message for variables that are not available at the current location.
- [#2389](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2389): Clicking the debugger Stop button too soon after starting a Flutter debug session should no longer result in the app continuing to build and launch. However, there may be a short delay before the process terminates.
- [#2361](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2361): A warning will now be shown when launching an app if the casing of the `cwd`/`program` fields do not match the casing on the underlying file system.

## Testing

- [#2380](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2380): Clicking **Stop** when paused in a test will now show a more obvious "Waiting for test to complete" notification.
- [#2385](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2385): Clicking **Stop** when paused in a test will now automatically disable breakpoints and resume the test to allow it to complete and the session to end cleanly.
- [#2362](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2362): `test()`s and `group()`s with variables in the name are now runnable from CodeLens links with some caveats.
- [#2349](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2349): Running tests from the test tree and with the **Dart: Run Test at Cursor** command is now possible even if another debug session is running.
- [#2351](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2351): The `flutter_test` package is no longer incorrectly marked as user-code so will not be debuggable when in **Debug my code** mode.
- [#2343](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2343): Running tests in the Dart SDK repo now (again) uses the VM directly.
- [#2335](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2335): Running tests in a folder named `test` for a non-web project will no longer show a spurious error about not being supported.

## Commands

- [#2336](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2336): The **Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor** command no longer writes to an output window that is hidden by default.
- [#2377](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2377): The **Dart: Run all Tests** command now works when your projects are in sub-folders of the open workspace.
- [#2285](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2285)/[#2369](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2369): [Bootblock](https://github.com/Bootblock) contributed a new **Dart: Rerun Last Test Session** command which works like **Dart: Rerun Last Debug Session** but only considering recent test debug sessions.

## Remoting Support

- [#2376](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2376): Joining a Live Share session will no longer show a warning about editing loose Dart files.
- [#2092](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2092)/[#2353](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2353): Flutter web debugging works when in a VS Code remoting session via the [Dart Debug extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dart-debug-extension/eljbmlghnomdjgdjmbdekegdkbabckhm). This requires >= v1.18.0-5.0 of the Flutter SDK.

## Other

- [#2310](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2310): Invalid log paths (eg. copied from other machines) no longer result in activation failures with cryptic error messages.
