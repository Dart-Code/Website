# v3.13.0 *2020-07-31*

## Improved Debug Discoverability

[#2216](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2216)/[#2677](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2677): Launch configurations for common cases are now contributed dynamically based on the contents of your project. These show up when clicking the **Show all automatic debug configurations** link on the Run side bar when there's no `launch.json` or by running the **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** command.

The configurations that show up are conditional based on your project (for example whether it's a Flutter project, and whether it has tests). Clicking the cog icon will copy the launch configuration into your `launch.json` to allow you to customize if required.

[#2676](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2676): Following [new VS Code guidelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_47#_single-file-debugging), a Run and Debug icon will appear in the editor toolbar when the active file can be directly run/debugged by the Dart extension.

## Improved Handling of Unsupported Platforms

[#2602](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2602)/[#2651](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2651): If the Flutter project you have open does not support a platform simply because its project files are missing (for example you have enabled web or desktop previews but are missing the `web`/`macos` folders), the relevant device will now show up at the bottom of the device selector as "Enable (device)".

<img src="/images/release_notes/v3.13/unsupported_devices.png" width="700" height="215" />

Selecting the device will allow you to easily run `flutter create .` in the project to create the missing files.

## Embedded DevTools Improvements

[#2655](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2655)/[#2661](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2661): When the [Embedded DevTools preview](/releases/v3-12/#preview-embedded-devtools) is enabled, clicking Dart DevTools in the status bar will now allow you to select which DevTools page to open, or load DevTools in an external browser.

<img src="/images/release_notes/v3.13/devtools_options.png" width="700" height="210" />

[#2679](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2679): Additionally, DevTools will now use the same background color as VS Code as long as it's dart/light enough to not cause contrast issues. This change requires a Dart DevTools release too so may not be visible immediately.

## Test File Creation

[#2650](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2650)/[#2662](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2662): The existing **Go to Test/Implementation** command has been extended and now also appears as a context menu entry labelled **Go to Tests** in the explorer tree.

<img src="/images/release_notes/v3.13/go_to_tests_explorer.png" width="490" height="140" />

If the related test file does not already exist, you will be prompted to create it.

<img src="/images/release_notes/v3.13/go_to_tests_create.png" width="515" height="150" />

The file created will contain a stub test that uses `package:test` or `package:flutter_test` depending on the type of the open workspace.

<img src="/images/release_notes/v3.13/go_to_tests_created.png" width="700" height="240" />

This functionality works best if your test files match the paths of your implementation files, swapping `lib` for `test` and adding a `_test` suffix to the filename.

## Flutter

- [#2600](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2600): Quick-fixes like "Wrap with Column" now work correctly for multiline selections instead of only wrapping the widget from the first line.
- [#2606](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2606)/[#2615](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2615): Color previews in the gutter will now show only the first preview on a line instead of the last.
- [#2639](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2639): When using a new enough Flutter SDK, a small debounce delay when performing hot-reload has been removed (and instead moved to Flutter with a shorter delay).
- [#2586](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2586)/[#2599](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2599): A race condition that could cause a Flutter app run in Profile mode to hang on a white screen at startup has been resolved.

## Editor

- [#2625](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2625): A new setting `dart.enableSnippets` allows disabling the built-in Dart and Flutter code snippets.
- [#2539](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2539): CodeLens links now appear above test methods even if `package:test` is added to the `pubspec.yaml` after the file was opened for the first time.
- [#2454](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2454): CodeLens links will no longer jump around as you type on the line above.
- [#2590](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2590): `pub get` no longer runs automatically for pubspecs modified inside dot-folders or the `build` folder.

## Debugger

- [#2665](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2665): The limit on the number of `toString()` methods the debugger will call when inspecting values has been increased from 15 to 100.
- [#2635](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2635)/[#2637](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2637): A new setting `dart.debugExtensionBackendProtocol` allows switching from WebSockets to Dart SSE for the debug extension backend when debugging web apps using the Dart Debug extension and Flutter web-server device.
- [#2611](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2611): VS Code should no longer report "Timeout after 1000ms" when terminating a debug session.
- [#2683](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2683)/[#2684](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2684): [szotp](https://github.com/szotp) contributed a change to show full `dart:developer log()` messages without truncation.

## Testing

- [#2619](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2619): Test durations shown in the test tree are now accurate and do not show the time taken since the start of the entire run.
- [#2609](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2609)/[#2614](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2614): Tests run from the `test_driver` folder will now automatically have the `VM_SERVICE_URL` enviroment variable set if an instrumented app is running.

## LSP Preview

These items only apply when running with the `dart.previewLsp` setting enabled. This will become the default in future, so please do try it out and send feedback!

- [#2634](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2634): The analysis server log now includes the arguments used to launch the server in LSP mode.
- [#2633](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2633): When running in LSP mode, any output to the servers `stderr` stream is now correctly logged to the log file.
