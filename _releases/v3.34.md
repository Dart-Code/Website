# v3.34.0 *2022-??-??*

## Testing Improvements

- [#3791](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3791): Tests in nested projects no longer run multiple times when using the **Test: Run All Tests** command (which often led to package resolution errors as they were running in the context of their parent projects).
- [#3776](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3776): Using the `testGoldens` function from the from `golden_toolkit` package will no longer cause issues when trying to run/view the results of tests in the tree. Tests may still appear duplicated in the tree if you are using a version of `golden_toolkit` that does not include [this PR](https://github.com/eBay/flutter_glove_box/pull/140) (the fix for that is to upgrade the `golden_toolkit` package).
- [#3803](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3803)/[#3705](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3705): It's now possible to override the launch configuration used when running/debugging tests from the test runner. See the Debugger section below for an example.

## Debugger

- [#3759](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3759): Clickable paths in stack traces in the Debug Console now jump to the correct line number (instead of always line 1) for assertion failure errors.
- [#3803](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3803)/[#3802](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3802): Creating launch configurations for the standard `Run`/`Debug` CodeLens links has been simplified so that it can be done with a single field (and now also applies to executions of tests from the test runner):
	```js
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Tests (VM+Chrome, Static Seed)",
			"request": "launch",
			"type": "dart",
			// Set "templateFor" to a path for this config to be used for all
			// Run/Debug links on CodeLens, or running from the test runner.
			// Set to an empty string "" for it to apply to the whole project.
			"templateFor": "test", // everything in test folder
			"args": [
				"-p", "chrome,vm",
				"--test-randomize-ordering-seed=12345",
			],
			"env": {
				"MY_ENV_VAR": "foo"
			}
		}
	]
	```
- [#3749](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3749): The `customToolReplacesArgs` field in launch configurations (used to run custom tools in place of `dart` or `flutter` when launching apps) can now be used to replace _all_ tool arguments. However, custom tools must still be compatible with the tool they replace. Replacing/removing the `--start-paused` argument does not remove the requirement for the custom tool to start the app paused, for example.

## Editor

- [#3804](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3804): Class fields are no longer incorrectly colored like methods/functions.
- [#3788](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3788): The `dart.triggerSignatureHelpAutomatically` setting has been removed in favour of the built-in `editor.parameterHints.enabled` VS Code setting that does the same.
- [#3780](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3780): Pressing `<enter>` after starting a triple-quoted string (`'''` or `"""`) will no longer add unwanted indenting.

## Flutter

- [#3758](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3758): Flutter refactor commands [in the context menu of Flutter Outline](https://dartcode.org/images/release_notes/v3.3/flutter_outline.png) no longer fail on newer SDK versions.
- [#3767](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3767): Trying to use `"console": "terminal"` or `"console": "externalTerminal"` in the launch configuration for a Flutter app will now produce a notification that this is not supported (instead of being silently ignored).
- [#3756](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3756): The `customTool` field for launch configurations is now supported for Flutter apps.

## Tasks

- [#3795](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3795): Contributed tasks accessible via the **Task: Run Task** command can now be run for projects in sub-folders (eg. a monorepo) instead of only at the VS Code "workspace folder" level.
- [#3801](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3801): The **Dart: Generate Documentation** command now uses the new `dart doc` command instead of the deprecated `dartdoc` when using a recent enough SDK.

## Pub

- [#3764](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3764): Pub packages fetched by the extension (`devtools`, `webdev`) will no longer be reactivated every session if the current latest published version has been retracted.

## Docs

- [#3798](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3798): The [docs explaining the **Dart: Use Recommended Settings** command](https://dartcode.org/docs/recommended-settings/) now make it clear that the comand is only visible when a Dart project is open.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#3783](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3783): Code completion no longer activates while typing in standard double-slash comments that are immediately before a dartdoc triple-slash comment.
- [#3778](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3778): A new `"instance"` semantic token modifier has been added to instance members, allowing them to be themed/colored separately to other symbols.
- [#3770](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3770): The **Create Method 'xxx'** fix now includes the `required` keyword for required named arguments if the library is null-safe.
- [#3761](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3761): Using analysis server plugins such as `cart_code_metrics` will no longer cause the servers view of a file to become out-of-sync with the editor, resulting in spurious diagnostic errors/warnings being reported.
- [#3697](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3697): The **Dart: Sort Members** command now correctly moves end-of-line comments along with the code on that line.
- [#3422](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3422): A new lint [`conditional_uri_does_not_exist`](https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/conditional_uri_does_not_exist.html) allows validating conditional import URIs to ensure they exist.
- [#1160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1160): Hover tooltips now include the static type of a variable, which may be different to the declared type (for example if the variable is used in an `is` check).
- [#3784](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3784): Code completion should now include members that can be overridden more reliably.
- [#3440](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3440): New packages added to `pubspec.yaml` should now be available more reliably after saving and waiting for the *`pub get` command to complete.
- [#3438](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3438): Fetching packages in a Flutter project should no longer intermitently result in the `flutter_gen` package failing to resolve.
