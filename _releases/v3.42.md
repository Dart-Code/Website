[#3811](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3811): It's now possible to add multiple dependencies in one step using **Dart: Add Dependency** using commas between package names.

## Flutter

- [#3998](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3998): New icons added in Flutter 3.0 (such as `solar_power`, `safety_check`) now have previews in hovers/completion.
- [#3997](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3997): `CupertinoIcons.location` no longer shows the wrong icon preview in hovers/completion.
- [#3949](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3949): A new Flutter task/command (**Flutter: Generate Localizations**) has been added (including in context menus/title bar for `.arb` files) that runs `flutter gen-l10n`.
- [#3961](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3961): Support for initializing the Flutter SDK when installed by a package manager has been generalised to support package managers other than Snap (such as Hermit).
- [#3968](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3968): The `dart.flutterShowEmulators` setting now has an additional value `"never"` which always hides emulators from device selection picklists.
- [#3971](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3971)/[#3965](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3965): [@nilsreichardt](https://github.com/nilsreichardt) contributed a fix to move the call to `super.dispose()` to the end of the `dispose()` method in the `stanim` snippet. Note: When snippets are being provided by the language server, the `dispose()` call will still be at the start of the method until the next Dart/Flutter SDK releases.

## Editor

- [#3782](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3782): Documentation in hovers and code completion can now render basic HTML tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<blockquote>` .
- [#3989](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3989): File nesting patterns have been added to nest several generated files like `pubspec.lock` and `.packages` under the `pubspec.yaml` file and `foo.g.dart` under `foo.dart`. File nesting can be enabled using the `explorer.fileNesting.enabled` setting (and default state with the `explorer.fileNesting.expand` setting).
- [#3995](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3995): The `dart.hotReloadOnSave` and `dart.flutterHotReloadOnSave` settings have been updated to include new values `"manualIfDirty"` and `"allIfDirty"` that will trigger hot-reload-on-save only if the saved file(s) are dirty. The default value remains `"manual"` to better support auto-save. The `"always"` setting has been renamed to `"all"`.
- [#3996](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3996): Code Actions that generate code with suggested names (such as **Assign value to new local variable**) no longer insert snippet markup text into the file.
- [#3969](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3969): Snippets like `for` no longer fail to appear in apps with large dependencies (including Flutter apps).
- [#3954](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3954): When using Dart 2.17/Flutter 3.0 with LSP disabled, snippets will no longer fail to show up.
- [#3946](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3946): If a language server request fails, the Output pane will no longer be automatically focused before clicking the "Go to Output" button.

## Testing

- [#3963](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3963): Improvements have been made to the recording of test messages that show up in the Test Error Peek window for failed tests. The final failure message should now show up instead of a generic "The test failed" message.

## DevTools

- [#3967](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3967): Using the `dart.devToolsLogFile` setting to log communication with the DevTools server no longer fails to record any traffic.

## Docs / Website

- [#3994](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3994): Descriptions on the `dart.sdkPath` and `dart.sdkPaths` settings (and equivalent Flutter settings) have been improved tp make it clearer that the `sdkPaths` settings are used only for SDK switching and not for initial SDK searching.
- [#3824](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3824): Docs now contain additional examples for how to configured launch configurations for Dart (non-Flutter) web apps.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Flutter 3.0/Dart 2.17

A number of features/fixes noted from in previous release notes that relied on an updated Dart/Flutter SDK are now available to stable channel users that have upgraded to Flutter 3.0/Dart 2.17, including:

- [#3873](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3873): Code completion for zero-argument functions no longer places the cursor inside the parens.

- [#3869](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3869): Some code actions like **Surround with if** now have improved snippet support and will provide better selections after inserting code.
- [#3867](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3867): Holding `ctrl` when hovering over paths to examples in Flutter dartdocs will no longer highlight significantly more of the file than included in the path.
- [#3864](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3864): "A request has failed" errors will no longer appear if you navigate to files that reference Flutter colors that are outside of the workspace (such as Flutter SDK sources or Pub package sources).

- [#1160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1160): Hover tooltips now include the static type of a variable, which may be different to the declared type (for example if the variable is used in an `is` check).
- [#3784](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3784): Code completion should now include members that can be overridden more reliably.
- [#3440](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3440): New packages added to `pubspec.yaml` should now be available more reliably after saving and waiting for the *`pub get` command to complete.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#3952](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3952): Using `source.fixAll` in `editor.codeActionsOnSave` is no longer very slow (despite the command being very fast when run on its own).

- [#3981](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3981): "Add curly braces" now shows as a Quick-fix for the `always_put_control_body_on_new_line` lint.
- [#3970](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3970): Ctrl+Click/Go-to-Definition now works on filenames in "part of" directives.
