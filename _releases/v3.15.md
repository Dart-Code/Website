## Editor

- [#2813](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2813): Code-fixes that include suggestion drop-downs will no longer generate incorrect code when one of the suggestions contains a comma.

The following changes include changes in the SDK and therefore may only apply when you are using a new enough SDK version. Those marked LSP may only apply when using the LSP preview (`"dart.previewLsp": true` in your VS Code settings).

- [#2818](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2818): Refactor error messages will no longer show an empty string `""` for unnamed libraries, instead showing a relative path.
- [#2781](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2781): Signature help will now show "required" against parameters that are marked with the `required` keyword.
- [#2766](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2766): "Create missing overrides" will no longer sometimes generate invalid code on Windows.
- [#2762](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2762): The **Dart: Sort Members** command will no longer sometimes delete comments alongside `import`s.
- [#2680](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2680): The `dart.analysisExcludedFolders` setting is now supported for LSP.
- [#1132](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1132): The signature information popup will now appear automatically when typing `(` and `,` in appropriate places (LSP).
- [#602](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/602)/[#2764](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2764): Loose `.dart` files can now be opened without a workspace folder (LSP).
- [#2727](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2727): The "Convert quotes" quick-fixes are now available for interpolated strings.

## Commands

- [#2807](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2807): A new command **Dart: Generate Documentation** has been added to run `dartdoc`. This is also available when editing a `dartdoc_options.yaml` file and as a VS Code Task.
- [#2777](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2777): The error "Unable to execute Stagehand. SyntaxError" will no longer appear the first time you run **Dart: New Project** after upgrading your SDK.

## DevTools

- [#2226](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2226): A new setting (`dart.devToolsBrowser`) allows launching DevTools in your default browser instead of Chrome.

## Debugger

- [#2784](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2784): Hitting a breakpoint in a web app now jumps to the currect source code.
