# v3.68.0 *2023-07-03*

## Automatically Clone Flutter SDK

[#4532](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4532): When no suitable Flutter SDK is found, the "Download SDK" button will now attempt to use Git to clone an SDK before launching the Download page from the Flutter website. You will be prompted for a location to download the SDK to and the path will automatically be written into the `dart.flutterSdkPath` setting.

## Add Dart/Flutter SDK to PATH Environment Variable

[#4604](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4604): New commands **Add Dart SDK to PATH** / **Add Flutter SDK to PATH** will attempt to add your current SDK to the PATH environment variable automatically. This is currently only supported on Windows, but other platforms will provide a link to additional information. You'll be prompted for this automatically if you use the Clone Flutter SDK flow noted above.

## Editor

- [#4615](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4615): The textmate grammar for basic syntax highlighting has been updated to v1.2.2.
- [#4384](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4384): Test icons in the gutter are no longer duplicated when pressing `<enter>` in the first line of a test definition.
- [#4608](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4608): A warning will now be shown if `dart.sdkPath`/`dart.flutterSdkPath` are configured but do not resolve to a valid SDK.

## Commands

- [#4606](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4606): The **Dart: New Project** and **Flutter: New Project** input boxes no longer close automatically if focus is lost. This allows you to tab away (for example to copy/paste values) without having to start over. Pressing `<escape>` will still cancel project creation.
- [#4581](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4581): Folders that contain `__` or `\{\{` are now excluded from automatic `pub get` checks, since these are often template directories and not valid projects.

## Testing

- [#4602](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4602): Formatting of Flutter error messages in the Test Error popup has been fixed.
- [#4594](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4594): Expanding a test file in the test explorer tree that is not open will no longer often fail to discover tests in that file.
- [#4553](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4553): The "Run All Tests" action handles excluded suites better and now produces shorter command lines (reducing the chance of "Command line too long" on Windows).


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically after you upgrade to the next (non-hotfix) Dart/Flutter SDK release in future. If you're using a recent bleeding-edge version, these items should already be available to you and any issues should be reported on GitHub in the usual way.

All of these issues relate to using the new SDK debug adapters that are being gradually rolled out:

- [#4599](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4599): Breakpoints in a file will no longer sometimes be left "unverified" when adding/removing other breakpoints in that file.
- [#4420](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4420): The debug adapter now drops references to variables, scopes and stack frames when execution resumes to reduce memory usage over long debug sessions.
- [#4287](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4287): Running Dart CLI apps using `cliConsole=terminal` will no longer show the terminal and then switch back to the Debug Console when the app launches.
- [#4505](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4505): Skipped tests no longer show ticks which made them look like passing tests.
- [#4542](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4542): Triggering a hot reload during application launch will no longer report "DebugAdapterException: app 'null' not found".
- [#4577](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4577): The Flutter debug adapter now supports the `vmServiceInfoFile` field which is useful for attaching debug sessions to Flutter instances started by other tools that can produce this file.
- [#4597](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4597): The pause action is now available.
