# v3.22.0 *2021-05-03*


## Flutter Integration Testing

[#3009](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3009)/[#3133](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3133): Flutter tests inside an `integration_test` folder are now recognised as tests and run on the selected device. See [flutter.dev/docs/testing/integration-tests](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/integration-tests) for more information on using the Flutter SDK's `package:integration_test`.

## Editor

_Items here marked "(requires SDK update)" also rely on changes in the Dart/Flutter SDKs so may not be immediately visible depending on your Dart/Flutter SDK channel._

- [#3303](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3303): When using LSP and the `completeFunctionCalls` setting, code completion will no longer insert additional parenthesis/argument placeholders when they already exist in the document (requires SDK update).
- [#3289](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3289): Brackets around references in dartdoc comments are no longer colored inconsistently when using LSP with Semantic Tokens (requires SDK update).
- [#3281](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3281): Code completion no longer incorrectly returns results when invoked in a comment right at the end of a file.
- [#3253](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3253)/[#3250](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3250): Renaming files that do not need to update any `import` statements will no longer trigger the VS Code refactor prompt (requires SDK update for LSP, not for non-LSP).
- [#3227](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3227): Code completion no longer shows duplicate classes when multple libraries are imported that re-export the same symbols (requires SDK update).
- [#3225](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3225): Code folding now works for Enum bodies (requires SDK update).
- [#3211](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3211): Code completion now intelligently triggers automatically for LSP when typing imports/slashes/interpolation(requires SDK update).
- [#3248](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3248): A new setting `dart.automaticCommentSlashes` has been added to control the new automatic comment marker behaviour added in the previous release.
- [#3174](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3174): Code completion now includes `?` in the display of nullable types in signatures and descriptions.

## Flutter

- [#3302](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3302): Custom emulators (using `flutterCustomEmulators`) now show error messages if they fail to launch.
- [#3267](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3267): Custom emulators (using `flutterCustomEmulators`) can now define additional environment variables using the `env` key.
- [#3258](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3258): Automatic Flutter initialization now works even if you have no other Dart SDKs on `PATH`.
- [#3246](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3246): When using embedded DevTools, `dart.openDevTools` will now open the embedded Inspector page for Flutter apps instead of opening a separate browser. For non-Flutter apps, DevTools will still be launched in a browser.

## Debugger

- [#3294](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3294): Custom CodeLens templates can now use exact file paths in their `path` filter instead of only folders.

## Commands

- [#3275](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3275): Embedded DevTools is now disabled for IDEs like Theia that do not support iframed webviews.
- [#3274](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3274): Embedded DevTools are now supported for Remote VS Code sessions where the necessary ports can be forwarded.
- [#3261](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3261): VS Code shortcut keys (like the command palette) now work even when embedded DevTools has focus (requires DevTools update).

- [#2853](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2853)/[#3292](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3292): Snap support has been simplified and should now work more reliably if you have never run `flutter` since installing the Snap package.
- [#3257](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3257): The **New Project** commands now spawn in the current window instead of opening new windows.
- [#3256](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3256): LSP will no longer be enabled by default for editor versions that do not meet the minimum required version for the LSP client.
