# v2.26.1 *2019-05-01*

- [#1651](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1651): When multiple pubspecs change at once (for example during a git branch change), a prompt will be shown offering to fetch packages (sequentially).
- [#1659](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1659): `pub get` will no longer fire multiple times concurrently during creation of projects with `Dart: New Project` and `Flutter: New Project`.
- [#1666](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1666): Projects created with `Flutter: New Project` will once again show the device selector in the status bar without having to reload the folder after initial creation.


# v2.26.0 *2019-04-26*

## Auto-Importing from Code Completion

[#1060](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1060): Code completion now lists symbols that are not yet imported and will auto-import the required library when selected.

Items will show "Auto import from xyz" in their details when this will occur.

The import will be added once the selected item is committed. This also works for part files, where the import will be added to the relevant parent file.

This feature requires v2.2.1 of the Dart SDK and can be disabled with the `dart.autoImportCompletions` setting.

## Improved Dependencies Tree

The dependencies tree has been updated and improved. It's now ([#1591](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1591)) be available for workspaces that have multiple projects (either in sub-folders, or as part of a multi-root workspace), ([#1622](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1622)) sorts folders above files and ([#1621](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1621)) no longer shows projects in their own dependencies list.

- [#1633](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1633): Update notifications are no longer shown after the first install.

- [#1599](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1599): Optional settings are now defined as such so that editing them in the VS Code Settings UI does not update them to default values for the data type (such as `0` or `""`).
- [#1618](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1618): Notifications for Dart DevTools will no longer be shown when running tests.
