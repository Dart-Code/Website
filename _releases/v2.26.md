# v2.26.0 *2019-04-26*

# Auto-Importing from Code Completion

[#1060](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1060): Code completion now lists symbols that are not yet imported and will auto-import the required library when selected.

Items will show "Auto import from xyz" in their details when this will occur.

The import will be added once the selected item is committed. This also works for part files, where the import will be added to the relevant parent file.

This behaviour can be disabled with the `dart.autoImportCompletions` setting.

# Improved Dependencies Tree

The dependencies tree has been updated and improved. It's now ([#1591](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1591)) be available for workspaces that have multiple projects (either in sub-folders, or as part of a multi-root workspace), ([#1622](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1622)) sorts folders above files and ([#1621](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1621)) no longer shows projects in their own dependencies list.
