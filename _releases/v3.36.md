# v3.36.0 *2022-03-01*

## Flutter

- [#3838](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3838): Flutter Apps runs in profile mode will no longer start with paused isolates (which the debugger must unpause) which could make them appear to run more slowly.
- [#3815](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3815): Running an app in Release mode has been simplified with the addition of a new command (**Debug: Run App in Release Mode**, an automatic launch configuration, and a launch configuration snippet), mirroring the same existing for Profile mode.
- [#3655](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3655): Online devices and offline emulators are now clearly seperated in the device selector.
- [#3827](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3827): `stful`/`stanim` snippets no longer generate public API using the private `State` subclass.
- [#3843](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3843): Icon previews in hovers are no longer missing for newly-added icons or those that start with numbers.
- [#3821](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3821): The "cold boot" emulator options now appear alongside their standard boot counterparts.
- [#3819](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3819): After creating a new project, the prompt shown advising you to press `F5` to start no longer notes that a device must be connected.
- [#3822](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3822): Generated debug session names no longer contain tags used to show icons in other parts of the UI.
- [#3842](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3842): Some additional "flutter build" tasks have been added and are now filtered by platform.
- [#3834](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3834): Having quotes around the `flutter` dependency in `pubspec.yaml` no longer prevents the project from being detected as a Flutter project.

## Debugger

- [#3840](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3840): Errors during evaluation in the watch/variables panels no longer show "function errorString" instead of the actual error message.
- [#3799](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3799): The VM Service URI used by DevTools will now be correctly mapped for use in remote workspaces (for example using VS Code's Remoting extensions for SSH or Docker).

## Commands

- [#3852](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3852): Launching DevTools in an external browser no longer writes an error to the VS Code developer console when using the latest (`master`) Flutter SDK.
- [#3817](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3817)/[#3818](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3818): [@tomgilder](https://github.com/tomgilder) contributed a new "Open in Xcode" short-cut for the `macos` folder in the explorer.
- [#3813](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3813): Using a new version of `pub` that does not create `.packages` files will no longer result in additional spurious prompts to fetch packages.

## Tasks

- [#3848](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3848): Customizing a Task in a multi-project folder (monorepo) no longer loses the working directory.
- [#1516](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1516): Running tasks automatically upon opening a project (using `runOptions` in `tasks.json`) no longer sometimes fails on Windows.
- [#3847](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3847): Running `build_runner` tasks on the latest stable SDK no longer prints "Deprecated. Use `dart run` instead."

## Experimental

- [#3769](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3769): A new setting `dart.experimentalSdkDaps` enables using new [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) implementations that will ship in the Dart/Flutter SDK. These are highly experimental and will only work with the latest development SDKs, but testing and bug reports are welcome.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#3846](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3846): The "Convert Getter to Method" assist now works for extensions.
- [#3844](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3844): Code completion no longer inserts unwanted commas when editing argument names.
- [#3823](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3823): A new "Convert to 'package:' import for everywhere in file" fix is available when using the `always_use_package_imports` lint.
- [#2492](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2492): The "Wrap with Column" refactor is now available when a Widget constructor is selected and not only when there is no selection.
- [#3830](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3830): The "Invalid file path" message sometimes shown when analysis fails will be more specific rather than a catch-all for several types of failure.
