excerpt: "'Flutter: New Project' command, improved SDK detection, missing package detection..."
---

# v2.9.2

- Running `Flutter: New Project` will no longer complain about missing SDKs if `dart` is not in your `PATH`

---

# v2.9.1

- A more appropriate error message is now shown when running `Flutter: New Project` when Flutter cannot be found

---

# v2.9.0

- A new command (`Flutter: New Project`) has been created to simplify the process of creating and opening a new Flutter project (unlike others, this command is in the palette even without a project open)
- Flutter and Dart debuggers have been merged, you will no longer be asked to choose between Flutter and Dart when running new projects!
   - As part of this, the `type` attribute on launch configurations in your `launch.json` will be automatically changed from `dart-cli`/`flutter` to `dart` upon opening the project
- Flutter projects no longer require a `launch.json` file if being launched with default arguments; if you hit F5 in a project without one it will just launch immediately
- If your packages are missing or out of date you will be prompted to run `pub get`/`flutter packages get` upon loading your project (this can be disabled with the new `dart.promptToGetPackages` setting, which can be set at the folder level)
- Snippets have been added for Flutter widgets (`stless`, `stful`, `stanim`) and will show only inside Flutter projects
- Quick Fixes and other code actions that insert code now support tab stops and selections (for example the `Wrap with new widget` assist will now select the text `widget` for you to type over)
- Code completions will no longer insert parentheses/argument placeholders if they are already present
- Code completions will no longer insert named argument placeholders if a value is already present
- A spinner will be shown in the status bar during analysis
- A spinner will be shown in the status bar while Flutter/Pub commands are running
- Quick fixes will now be sorted in the lighbulb menu by the severity of the error that they fix
- Quick fixes and code assists are now categorised as QuickFix and Refactor in Code to allow for keybinding a specific type
- SDKs will now be listed by version number in the SDK picker
- Snippets will no longer be prioritised over other completions in the completions list
- A workaround for a change in VS Code 1.20 that causes breakpoints to not be hit on Windows has been implemented
- Package restore commands will now be terminated and re-run if you invoke them again while they are already running (this includes if you change `pubspec.yaml` and save)
- Due to a number of issues with the implementation, external files (SDK, packages) will no longer open read-only (this behaviour may be restored in some form in future)
- Executing package restore commands in a workspace that has no `pubspec.yaml` on Windows will no longer get the extension stuck in a loop
- Saving `pubspec.yaml` in a Dart project will no longer run `flutter packages get` if you have a Flutter project in the same workspace
- Running `Flutter: Get Packages` will no longer sometimes unexpectedly ask you for the workspace folder to run the command in
- Opening a Dart file outside of a folder will no longer show errors in the developer console
- A new setting (`dart.previewDart2`) has been added which allows you to opt-in to Dart 2 behaviour such as optional `new`/`const` (you must be using an SDK that supports this!)
