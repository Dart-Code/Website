# v1.1.0

- Opening a folder that is not itself a Dart package but contains others (such as the Flutter repository) will no longer give false errors/warnings caused by incorrect package resolution
- Setting Dart SDK/libraries as debuggable/non-debuggable will now work correctly with SDK 1.23 which has different debugging defaults
- The `launch.json` file should now be much simpler than before and not contain internal Dart Code settings that are not relevant to the user *
- The `launch.json` file now properly supports default so `checkedMode: true` and `args: []` are no longer required unless being changed *

\* Your launch.json file should automatically be tidied up when you first open your project.
