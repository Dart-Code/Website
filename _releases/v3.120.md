# v3.120.1 _2025-10-21_

- [#5717](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5717): The Flutter Widget Preview is now enabled for the latest Flutter beta by default, without needing the `experimentalFlutterWidgetPreview` flag.
- [#5672](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5672): The Flutter Widget Preview icon has been updated to better match other Flutter sitebar icons.

# v3.120.0 _2025-09-30_

## Flutter

- [#5713](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5713): When downloading the Flutter SDK through the extension, the File Dialog now defaults to the users home directory.
- [#5711](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5711): The **Dart: Add Dart SDK to PATH** and **Flutter: Add Flutter SDK to PATH** commands (and associated actions during the Flutter SDK download) are now available on both Mac and Linux (for Bash and Zsh) in addition to Windows.

## Testing

- [#5729](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5729)/[#5727](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5727): A new setting `dart.experimentalTestTracking` enables tracking of tests within files. This should improve the reliability of test gutter icons and the "Go to Test" commands for tests that are not discoverable statically (for example dynamic tests, or those using `pkg:test_reflective_loader`). This will be enabled by default in a future release.
- [#5721](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5721): Code coverage is no longer collected for other packages that contain the name of the package being tested (for example if your app is named `app`, coverage will not be collected for `pkg:app_links`).
- [#5706](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5706): Code coverage is now correctly collected when your package name in `pubspec.yaml` does not match the name of the folder the package resides in.
- [#5693](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5693)/[#5696](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5696): Changes to test files made externally (for example by terminal-based coding agent) are now detected and the Test Explorer updated.
- [#5682](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5682): A small delay has been added before showing "Starting debug sessionâ€¦" to avoid the notification appearing briefly for debug sessions that start quickly.

## Commands

- [#5684](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5684): A new command **Flutter: Clean All Projects** cleans all Flutter projects in the workspace.
- [#4696](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4696): Commands related to Dart Observatory are now hidden for Dart SDKs since 3.9 (when Observatory was removed).

## Editor

- [#5694](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5694)/[#5695](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5695): Ctrl+Click on `package:` links in terminal/documents will no longer sometimes jump to the wrong version of a package.
- [#5692](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5692)/[#5698](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5698): Ctrl+Click on `package:` links will now show a Peek window showing multiple results when there are multiple versions of a package in the workspace and the link had no context to narrow to a specific version.

## Debugging

- [#5712](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5712): The **Debug: Attach to Dart Process** command now makes it clearer that a port number can be provided instead of a full URL.
- [#5670](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5670): The current open file is no longer used as a hint for what to launch when an explicit launch config is selected from a different workspace folder.
- [#5397](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5397): An issue with isolates appearing as "paused on entry" even if they're not paused has been fixed in the upcoming release of VS Code.

## Dart Tooling Daemon (DTD)

- [#5725](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5725)/[#5726](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5726): The `navigateToCode` editor service is now registered with DTD and can be called by other DTD clients to navigate the editor to a specific file/line/col.
- [#5718](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5718)/[#5720](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5720): The `getActiveLocation` editor service is now registered with DTD and can be used to get the open file/line/col. This complements the existing `activeLocationChanged` event stream.

## Cloud IDEs

- [#5680](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5680): Embedded DevTools pages no longer intermittently fail with errors like "Failed to connect to DTD" or "Failed to connect to VM Service" when running in some cloud IDEs like Firebase Studio.
- [#5158](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5158): All embedded DevTools pages should now work when running in some cloud IDEs like Firebase Studio.
- [#5683](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5683): The extension now starts up faster when running in Firebase Studio.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

### Widget Preview

Several improvements have been made to the integration with the Widget Preview functionality (which currently requires the Flutter `master` branch).

- [#5661](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5661): Devices/platforms that are not currently enabled can once again be enabled from the Flutter Sidebar.
- [#5652](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5652): Code completion for overriding methods once again sets the cursor position after completion.
