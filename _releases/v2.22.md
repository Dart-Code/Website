title: v2.22
sort_order: v0002_0022
excerpt: Create Flutter samples, Clickable error stacks, New refactors, plus many other editor improvements
---

# v2.22.3 *2019-01-31*

A bug that caused Flutter's Hot Reload to stop working if there were breakpoints in invalid locations has been fixed.

# v2.22.2 *2019-01-29*

A bug that prevented unhandled exceptions in Dart CLI apps being shown in the debug console has been fixed.

# v2.22.1 *2019-01-25*

The change to ignore `dart` binaries in your `PATH` that are not from the Dart SDK has been reverted because it broke handling of SDKs that came from symlinks in `PATH`. It will return in a future update minus the breakage.

# v2.22.0 *2019-01-25*

## Flutter: New Project From Docs

It's now possible to create sample projects from the Flutter docs directly in VS Code with a new command **Flutter: New Project From Docs**.

This command will list the sample projects currently available in the docs.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v2.22/flutter_new_project_from_docs_command_prompt.png" width="700" height="280" />

Selecting a sample will automatically run `flutter create --sample {sample ID}` and open the project for you.

**Note:** This functionality requires both v2.22 of [the Dart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) and v2.22 of [the Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter). While it's currently possible to develop for Flutter with only the Dart extension, this may cease to be the case in future as more functionality migrates to the Flutter extension so if you haven't already, you should [install it](vscode:extension/Dart-Code.flutter).

## Clickable Stack Trace Locations ðŸŽ‰

Dart and Flutter stack traces in the Debug Console now have clickable links!

## Run Test at Cursor

New commands have been added to run/debug the test for the current cursor location. The command is available in the same locations that the test CodeLens is available (the command will not be visible if your cursor is not in a valid location). For info on how to add key bindings, [see here](/docs/key-bindings/).

## New Refactors

A new **Extract Local Variable** refactor has been added.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v2.22/refactor_extract_local.png" width="600" height="100" />

This extracts the code under the cursor into a variable and will allow you to type over its name.

There's also a new **Convert Method to Getter** refactor to convert argument-less methods to getters.

## Prompt to Launch with Errors

The preview setting from the previous release is now named `dart.promptToRunIfErrors` (no `preview` prefix) and is enabled by default. This will result in a prompt when launching if errors exist in your project.

## Type Hierarchy Previews

The [Show Type Hierarchy command](https://dartcode.org/docs/commands/#dart-show-type-hierarchy) has been updated and will now preview the relevant code as you move the selection up and down the list.

## Editor Changes

- The **Rename** input box will now appear over the symbol to be renamed when invoked on a keyword (such as the prefix for `import`s, and the class/constructor names for `new`, `const` keywords)
- Code completion should no longer pop open showing Flutter snippets when typing in comments
- Code completion should now update correctly when typing spaces after arguments
- A new setting `dart.analysisExcludedFolders` (a string array) has been added to allow excluding folders from analysis
- Git dependencies that point to sub-folders of repositories will now show more accurate paths in the document symbol list
- Code completions that insert multiple lines (such as `@override`s) will now insert with the correct indentation
- Code blocks in dartdoc comments will no longer show in different colors depending on the indentation level
- Syntax highlighting has been improved
  - Functions with type arguments should now be colored the same as those without
  - `covariant` is now recognised a keyword
  - Nested multiline comments will now color correctly
- Only currently-visible documents are now considered priority by the analysis server (rather than anything that had been opened recently)
- The "editing files outside your workspace" warning has had some tweaks
  - It now refers to open workspaces as "Open Folders"
  - It will no longer show if you do not have any folders open
  - It has a "Don't Warn Me" button that'll hide it forever
  - The long path has been removed

## Command Changes

- Running `Flutter: Fetch Packages` will no longer prompt you for a project a second time if you cancel the first prompt
- The **Flutter: Fetch Packages** command will no longer sometimes contain "unwanted")}" characters in the prompt message

## Debugger Changes

- The Locals pane will no longer spin forever when stopped inside functions with type arguments
- Flutter runtime errors are now categories as `stderr` and will be colored accordingly in the Debug Console
- Stack frames will no longer show `[Unoptimized]` prefixes in the call stack
- Flutter will now automatically run with the `--verbose` flag when logs are being captured with the **Dart: Capture Logs** command

## Other Changes

- Having a `dart` binary in your `PATH` that is not the Dart VM will no longer result in activation errors
- `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` will now be included in log headers to help troubleshoot proxy issues
- The display of file/paths in the test runner has been tweaked
- The `Create Emulator` option will now always show in the device selection list, ignoring text filtering
- Timestamps are now supplied to the analysis server to allow monitoring of latency via the Diagnostics app
- Several MB of dependencies have been removed which should result in faster extension activation times
