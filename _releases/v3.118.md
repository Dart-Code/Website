# v3.118.2 _2025-09-19_

- [#4612](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4612)/[#5709](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5710): The ability to add SDKs to the `PATH` env variable for external terminals is now available for macOS.
- [#5709](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5709)/[#5709](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5710): Allowing the extension to clone Flutter via `git` no longer incorrectly shows an error saying the SDK cannot be located immediately after installing.

# v3.118.1 _2025-09-03_

- [#5681](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5681): Fixed an issue where spawning new processes (such as starting a Flutter debug session) could fail when the Flutter Widget Previewer experiment was enabled.

# v3.118.0 _2025-09-01_

## Deprecation of SDKs prior to Dart 3.1 / Flutter 3.13

[#5667](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5667): Support for SDKs prior to Dart 3.1 and Flutter 3.13 is being deprecated. If you are using affected versions you will be shown a one-time warning advising you to upgrade.

These SDKs will still work with this version (v3.118) but some functionality will stop working with the next release. A table showing which extension versions support which SDKs (and instructions on how to change extension version) is available on the [SDK Compatibility page](/sdk-version-compatibility/) if you need to continue to use unsupported SDKs.

## Flutter

- [#5623](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5623)/[#5631](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5631): Code coverage now includes dependencies that exist in the workspace, not only the app being tested.
- [#5673](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5673): Enabling a new device for Flutter apps now correctly selects the launch project when the active launch configuration references a different project to the active file.
- [#5651](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5651)/[#5653](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5653): A new setting `dart.useFlutterDev` allows use of `flutter-dev` instead of `flutter`. This script is intended for use by contributors to the `flutter` tool to avoid having to manually rebuild the tool when making local changes.

## AI

- [#5639](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5639): A new setting `dart.mcpServerTools` allows excluding some of the Dart MCP servers tools from registration with VS Code/Copilot. By default the `runTests` tool is excluded because it overlaps with an equivalent tool provided by VS Code.

## DevTools

- [#5675](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5675): DevTools no longer opens in external tabs in Firebase Studio when set to load embedded / in the sidebar.

## Testing

- [#5630](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5630): A new setting `dart.coverageExcludePatterns` allows excluding coverage from files/folders using globs. For example you could exclude `**/generated/**` or  `**/*.g.dart`.
- [#5654](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5654): Starting an integration test will now show a progress notification while the app build is in-progress, which will be hidden once the test begins and produces some output to the debug console.

## Commands

- [#5665](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5665): The **Dart: Add Dependency** command now supports space separators in addition to commas.


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5599](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5599): Go-to-Definition / `ctrl/cmd`+`click` on keywords like `return`, `break`, `continue` will now jump to the related function/statement.
- [#4844](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4844): When the text cursor is on a keyword like `return`, `break`, `continue`, other exit points of the same function/statement will be highlighted.


### Flutter Widget Previewer Preview

- [#5649](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5649)/[#5650](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5650): An experimental flag `experimentalFlutterWidgetPreview` enables an early preview of the [Flutter Widget Previewer](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/widget-previewer) which can be shown in the sidebar or an editor tab using the `dart.experimentalFlutterWidgetPreviewLocation` setting. Unlike the command-line version of the previewer, embedding in VS Code requires a Flutter version `>=3.36.0-1` (currently the `master` channel). Feedback about the previewer itself should be posted to https://github.com/flutter/flutter and feedback on the integration with VS Code to https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code.
