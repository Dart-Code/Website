# v3.12.0 *2020-06-25*

## Preview: Embedded DevTools

[#1488](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1488)/[#2578](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2578): A new setting (`dart.previewEmbeddedDevTools`) has been added that allows running DevTools embedded inside the VS Code window. This feature is experimental and requires DevTools v0.2.6 or later.

DevTools will become disconnected when you stop a debug session but if you leave the window open, it will be automatically reconnected when you start a new debug session.

## Cupertino Icons and Colors

[#2150](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2150)/[#2149](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2149): Cupertino icons and colors are now rendered in the gutter in addition to Material icons and colors.

## Debugger inspect()

[#2137](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2137)/[#2560](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2560): Calling [`dart:developer`'s `inspect()` function](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.4/dart-developer/inspect.html) will now print the object to the Debug Console in an expandable form allowing properties to be examined similar to the variables/watch panels.

Note: This only works for non-Widget classes as the Widget Inspector also uses this function in order to navigate source code.

## Improved Outlines

[#2475](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2475)/[#2515](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2515): Both the Flutter Outline and standard Outline trees have been updated with some additional labels (including return values and text/icons for Text/Icon widgets).

## Update Imports on Rename

[#2482](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2482)/[#2507](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2507): The update-imports-on-rename functionality [added in the last release](/releases/v3-11/#preview-update-imports-on-rename) is now enabled by default. Set `"dart.updateImportsOnRename": false` in your VS Code user settings to disable this.

## Editor

- [#2579](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2579): Colors constructed using hex values (for example `Color.fromARGB(0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff)`) will no longer show the wrong color in the gutter.
- [#2529](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2529): "Unknown Outline item! MIXIN" will no longer show in the debug console when editing documents containing mixins.
- [#2487](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2487)/[#2506](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2506): [BootBlock](https://github.com/BootBlock) enabled the "ignore lint quick-fix" by default (set `"dart.showIgnoreQuickFixes": false` to disable these).
- [#2163](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2163): The `dart.previewNewCompletionPlaceholders` setting has been folded into the `dart.insertArgumentPlaceholders` setting.
- [#1946](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1946): A one-time prompt will be shown offering to write [the recommended Dart settings](/docs/recommended-settings/) to your VS Code user settings file.

## Commands

- [#2503](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2503): The `PUB_HOSTED_URL` environment variable is now used when checking for new versions of DevTools/webdev/Stagehand (this prevents update checks failing for some users - [for example in China](https://flutter.dev/community/china)).

## Debugger

- [#2554](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2554): Restarting a dynamically started Dart debug session (for example from CodeLens or a test runner command) will no longer sometimes start a debug session using configuration from `launch.json` when clicking the Restart button.
- [#2541](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2541): [BootBlock](https://github.com/BootBlock) contributed a fix to stop sending multiple kill signals to the same process when ending debug sessions.
- [#2531](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2531): The prompt for a VM Service URL when attaching to processes now supports `ws` and `wss` protocols.
- [#2528](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2528): The "You have a breakpoint outside of your workspace" warning will no longer appear when you have set the debugger to break in SDKs/packages.
- [#2518](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2518): Debugger tooltips when hovering over a closure no longer show errors.
- [#2513](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2513): Running a Dart script in the terminal without debugging will no longer leave the debug session around even after the process ends requiring you to click Stop.
- [#2082](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2082): Running all tests using `"program": "test/"` in `launch.json` for Flutter apps will now automatically run without debugging (debugging while running all tests is not supported for Flutter).
- [#1850](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1850): Flutter's structured error messages are now enabled at startup flag, avoiding a race condition that used to exist when enabling them after the app started.
- [#2496](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2496): When using the Web-Server device (and the [Dart Debug extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dart-debug-extension/eljbmlghnomdjgdjmbdekegdkbabckhm)) a better message will be displayed when waiting for the debug extension to connect.
- [#2516](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2516):/[#2540](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2540): [BootBlock](https://github.com/BootBlock) switched the debuggers custom `dart.progress` events for standard debug-adapter-protocol progress events improving interopability for other editors using Dart-Code's debug adapter.

## LSP

Some issues have been fixed in the LSP server in the Dart SDK. These fixes only apply when using the preview LSP support (`"dart.previewLsp": true` in your VS Code user settings) and when using a new enough version of the Dart/Flutter SDKs (which may not yet include stable channels).

- [#2572](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2572): Go-to-Definition on an `import` that has an alias will no longer show multiple locations (one being the alias) and instead jump straight to the file.
- [#2535](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2535): Go-to-Definition on a `var`/`final` keyword will no longer show multiple locations (one being the variable name) and instead jump straight to the definition for the type of the varxiable.

## Other

- [#2501](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2501): Many references to "Observatory" have been updated to "VM Service" to distinguish between Observatory (the Dart debugging web app) and the VM Service (an API for the VM).
- [#2565](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2565): A regression in VS Code v1.46.0 caused some "run without debugging" sessions to incorrectly run *with* debugging. This was fixed by the v1.46.1 release of VS Code.
