# v3.9.0 *2020-04-03*

## Flutter: New Project Offline Mode

[#1957](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1957)/[#2311](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2311): [@ejabu](https://github.com/ejabu) Contributed a new setting `dart.flutterCreateOffline` that will force **Flutter: New Project** to run in offline-mode.

## Run Dart CLI apps in Terminal Improvements

[#2256](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2256)/[#2230](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2230)/[#2315](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2315)/[#2305](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2305)/[#2313](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2313): Running CLI apps in the terminal has received some improvements over the [original release](/releases/v3-7/#run-dart-cli-apps-in-terminal). Apps now run as real processes in a standard VS Code Terminal (instead of using a Pseudoterminal). This should resolve issues with certain keys (like backspace) not working correctly.

Note: You must be using Dart SDK v2.7.1 or later for this functionality to work.

## Debugger

- [#2282](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2282)/[#2283](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2283): The debugger should no longer get stuck in the running state if it pauses very quickly after being resumed.
- [#2314](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2314): The debug adapter now users the [debug adapter protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification)'s `runInTerminalRequest` for terminal mode instead of proprietary events, improving compatibility with other editors.

## Commands

- [#2289](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2289): **Dart: Run Test At Cursor** is now a little more lax about the positions of the cursor, including the whole start/end line for a group/test.
- [#2280](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2280): When running commands like **Pub: Get Packages**, the Output tab when no longer be shown automatically unless errors occur.

## Editor

- [#2296](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2296): Code snippets should no longer force the editor into "snippet mode" unnecessarily, preventing code completion from working.
- [#2228](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2228)/[#2272](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2272): Flutter Outline now updates more reliably for files outside of your workspace.
- [#2218](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2218): Color previews now appear in the gutter for colors using the `Color.fromARGB`/`Color.RGBO` constructors.
- [#2140](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2140)/[#2270](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2270): Format Document should no longer break some unicode characters in long documents.

## Testing

- [#2312](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2312): The **Dart: Run All Tests** comman can now be used if you're already in a debug session.
- [#2160](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2160): A new setting `dart.allowTestsOutsideTestFolder` controls whether files ending `_test.dart` outside of the test folder will be considered tests.

## Preview: LSP

[#2238](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2238)/[#2297](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2297): As part of ongoing work to migrate to the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), a new setting `dart.previewLsp` will force the analyzer to using the LSP protocol. This mode is not yet complete and has some [known issues](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2286).
