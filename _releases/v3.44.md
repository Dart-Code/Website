# v3.44.0 *2022-07-??*

## Flutter

- [#3993](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3993): A new setting `dart.flutterGenerateLocalizationsOnSave` allows the **Flutter: Generate Localizations** command to be run automatically when a `.arb` file is saved.
- [#4036](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4036): The **Wrap with widget** refactor will no longer sometimes insert snippet placeholders like `${0:widget}` in code.
- [#4002](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4002): The **Wrap with...** refactors will no longer sometimes remove escaping backslashes in the modified code.
- [#4007](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4007): Running Flutter tests with multiline names on Windows no longer fails with "No tests match regular expression 'test & exit /B 0'".
- [#4026](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4026): The **Flutter: Check Elevations** command has been removed because the underlying Flutter service was removed due to changes in layer positioning.

## General

- [#4001](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4001): [@blaugold](https://github.com/blaugold) contributed nesting `pubspec_overrides.yaml` under `pubspec.yaml` when `explorer.fileNesting` is enabled.
- [#3974](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3974): The default value of `dart.projectSearchDepth` has been increased from 3 to 5. This allows projects nested more deeply in your workspace to be found. Additionally, if the search for projects takes more than 1 second a progress indicator will be shown, allowing the search to be stopped early. Results from workspace searches are now also cached for a few minutes to improve performance.
- [#4011](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4011): Having folders from both Dart SDK repo and non-Dart SDK repo in the workspace no longer tries to use `pub` or `dart test` (which are not available for Dart SDK repo projects).
- [#3990](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3990): A new setting `dart.runPubGetOnNestedProjects` allows running `pub get` for nested parent/child projects when a `pubspec.yaml` is modified. This may be useful where you have nested projects with `path` dependencies (such as an `example` project) where both projects `package_config.json` files need regenerating when adding dependencies to one.

## Testing

- [#4032](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4032): The **Test: Run All Tests** command no longer fails if the workspace contains integration tests that are not valid for the current device. Instead, they will be skipped.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#3950](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3950): Code Actions such as **Dart: Sort Members** and **Organize Imports** will now fail silently if configured to run on-save (via `editor.codeActionsOnSave`) and show errors if invoked manually.
- [#4020](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4020): Ctrl+Click on constructor declarations now automatically searches for references (depending on VS Code settings) as it already did for other types of declarations.
- [#4017](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4017): The `fun` snippet to create functions has been restored.
- [#4000](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4000): The **Dart: Convert Method to Getter** and **Dart: Convert Getter to Method** refactors will no longer show up in locations where they are not valid (and would error if selected).
- [#4029](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4029): The **Dart: Extract Method** refactor no longer shows up for import prefixes.
- [#4027](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4027): Code completion will no longer sometimes insert a literal `(...)` instead of parameter placeholders (affected Dev builds only).
- [#3943](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3943): Code completion for symbols that start with `$` that are not yet imported will no longer insert duplicate `$`s when selected.
- [#3945](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3945): Error messages shown when trying to launch DevTools for a build that does not support it have been improved.
