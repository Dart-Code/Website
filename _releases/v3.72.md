# v3.72.0 *2023-09-04*

## Move to File Refactoring

[#4518](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4518): When using the latest Flutter release (v3.13), the Move to File refactoring is available without setting any experimental flags.

## Improved "Flutter: New Project" Template Selection

[#4706](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4706): Project templates in the **Flutter: New Project** command have been updated to make it clearer which templates are applications and which are other project types.

## Flutter

- [#4686](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4686): Cloning the Flutter SDK as part of the "No SDK Found" flow no longer uses `--single-branch` which prevented using `flutter channel` to change channel.
- [#4685](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4685): Clicking the Hot Reload button on the debug toolbar will now automatically save all files before issuing the hot reload.
- [#4702](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4702): Dart projects that reference the Flutter SDK in comments in `pubspec.yaml` no longer cause the project to be treated as a Flutter project.
- [#4677](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4677): A new command `flutter.getSelectedDeviceId` is available which returns the ID of the currently selected Flutter device. This can be used in `tasks.json` to pass the device ID to external tasks.

## Testing

- [#4681](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4681): Test failures in `tearDownAll` are now longer attributed to the correct line but wrong file when `tearDownAll` is called from a file other than the one containing the test.
- [#4676](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4676): Folders excluded via `analysis_options.yaml` are now treated like those in `dart.analysisExcludedFolders`, including being excluded from the test runner. `analysis_options.yaml` is the recommended way to exclude files/folders nested inside a Dart project and `dart.analysisExcludedFolders` is recommended for excluding larger folders that are not nested inside a Dart project for performance reasons (for example to exclude `node_modules` folders from non-Dart projects in the workspace).
- [#4710](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4710): The spinner indicating a test is running should no longer sometimes persist in the gutter even after the test run completes.

## Commands

- [#4709](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4709): The **Get Packages** commands will no longer cause any nested `example` folders to have their packages fetched twice.
- [#4708](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4708): When using the SDK switcher, paths written into `dart.sdkPath` and `dart.flutterSdkPath` will now use `~` and forward slashes when the path is inside your home directory to help share config between teams (if they agree to store versioned SDKs in the same location).
- [#4698](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4698): A new command **Dart: Copy VM Service URI to Clipboard** will copy the VM Service URI of the current debug session to the clipboard.
- [#4697](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4697): The **Dart: Open Observatory** command is now marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future update once removed from the SDK.


## Editor

- [#4701](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4701): Searching the Workspace Symbols list has been fixed when using the legacy analyzer protocol (`dart.useLegacyAnalyzerProtocol`). The legacy protocol is not recommended (and will eventually be removed) - if you feel you need to use it please [file an issue](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues) with the details.
- [#4631](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4631): The error "LanguageStatusItem with id 'dart.analysisServer' ALREADY exists" will no longer appear in the console sometimes when using the legacy analyzer protocol.
- [#4583](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4583): A recent VS Code update prevented imports from being added automatically when completing code in `part` files. This change was reverted and these imports should work again.



## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. Many are already available in the current beta channels though some are currently only available on bleeding-edge builds and will show up in future beta/stable SDK releases.


- [#4640](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4640): Hovering over a wildcard pattern now shows its static type.
- [#2462](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2462): Code completion now shows the signatures/return types for all items and not only the selected item.
- [#4598](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4598): Breakpoints should no longer sometimes disappear when adding/removing breakpoints when there are multiple isolates running.
- [#4668](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4668): `Find All References` now works correctly on class declarations.
- [#4655](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4655): When using `editor.codeActionsOnSave` to run `source.fixAll`, unused parameters will no longer be removed. They will still be removed if you invoke the **Fix All** command explicitly.
- [#4635](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4635): The `switch expression` snippet no longer shows up when completing named arguments.
- [#4619](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4619): **Go to Definition** now works when you have a selection that ends at the start of a set of type arguments.
- [#4564](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4564): **Extract Method** now correctly marks functions extracted from function expressions in static fields as `static`.
