## LSP Improvements

Several improvements have been made when running with the [LSP Preview](/releases/v3-16/#language-server-protocol-preview). Many of these rely on changes in the Dart language server so may not be immediately available depending on the Dart/Flutter channel you are using. At the time of writing, they have not yet reached the Flutter stable channel.

- [#3010](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3010): `TODO` comments now show in the problems list if `dart.showTodos` is `true`.
- [#2808](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2808): Placeholders for parameters marked with the `required` keyword are now inserted when completing a function/method when `dart.completeFunctionCalls` is enabled.
- [#1960](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1960): Placeholders for parameters marked with the `@required` annotation are now inserted when completing a function/method when `dart.completeFunctionCalls` is enabled.
- [#3006](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3006): Selecting `setState` from completion no longer inserts two function placeholders.
- [#2992](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2992): Completions for some auto-import functions no longer fail to include parens/arguments when `dart.completeFunctionCalls` is enabled.
- [#2975](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2975): Code completion no longer inserts unnecessary tabstops for some functions that could prevent code completion from working if `editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions` has not been disabled.

## Flutter

- [#3016](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3016)/[#3026](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3026): New settings `dart.flutterRunAdditionalArgs` and `dart.flutterAttachAdditionalArgs` have been added that behave like `dart.flutterTestAdditionalArgs` but injecting args into `flutter run` and `flutter attach` commands run by the debugger respectively.
- [#2999](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2999)/[#3000](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3000): A new setting `dart.flutterWebRenderer` allows easily setting [Flutter's web renderer](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers) at the global (User Settings) level or per-workspace.
- [#2963](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2963)/[#3004](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3004): New commands have been added to create module, plugin and package Flutter projects. The original **Flutter: New Project** command is now named **Flutter: New Application Project** to avoid ambiguity.

## Editor

- [#2984](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2984)/[#2991](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2991): The "Dart from Flutter" label no longer shows in the status bar when the active file is HTML.
- [#2575](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2575): Syntax highlighting no longer colors unicode characters following a variable/expression as part of the variable.

## Commands

- [#3013](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3013)/[#3014](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3014): Folders inside `.dart_tool` that contain `pubspec.yaml` files will no longer show up in the project list.
- [#2989](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2989)/[#2994](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2994): The **New Project** commands now allow selecting a folder before entering a name and will pre-populate the name with a placeholder that does not already exist on disk.

## Testing

- [#2832](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2832): A warning will now be shown when running individual tests using CodeLens if multiple tests are run (as a result of having multiple tests with the same name).
