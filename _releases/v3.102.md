# v3.102.0 _2024-12-02_

## Flutter

- [#5353](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5353): The "Peek Error" popup shown when a test fails now shows the full output of a test instead of only the last output event (which for Flutter integration tests is often just the bottom of an ascii box `==========================`).

## Editor

- [#5327](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5327): The TextMate grammar (used for syntax highlighting before semantic tokens are available and for themes that do not support semantic tokens) has been updated to resolve some issues with unclosed code blocks in documentation comments.
- [#5345](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5345): The warning shown when `dart.sdkPath` or `dart.flutterSdkPath` contain an invalid path has been updated to include the path in the message to make it easier to spot issues like unescaped backslashes if pasting Windows paths into the JSON settings file.

## Debugger

- [#5252](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5252): Threads/isolates in the debugger will no longer sometimes show incorrect paused/resumed state when multiple isolates are used.

## Docs / website

- [#5348](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5348): The [settings page](/docs/settings/) has been updated to include a number of previously-missing settings.
- [#5347](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5347): The descriptions for many path settings (such as `dart.analyzerPath`) have been updated to note when `~` can be used to indicate the home directory.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

This can be invoked from the command palette or context menu.

- [#5324](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5324): The `label` custom semantic token modifier is now correctly applied to argument names when the type is `dynamic`.
- [#4794](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4794): Code completion now works correctly on enums that are imported with a prefix.
- [#5165](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5165): Several issues have been fixed in Flutter that could cause `flutter_test` processes to be leaked when terminating a test run.
