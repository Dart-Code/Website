# v3.112.0 _2025-06-02_

## DevTools / Widget Inspector Embedded in Sidebar

[#5469](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5469): Using DevTools in the sidebar no longer requires an experiment flag. By default, the Inspector page will be shown in the sidebar but this can be changed with the `dart.devToolsLocation` setting:

```js
// Customise which sections are shown in the sidebar, in an editor tab, or external browser.
"dart.devToolsLocation": {
	// Default values are to show the Inspector in the sidebar and others
	// beside the code editor.
	"inspector": "sidebar",
	"default": "beside",
},
```

## Inline Values During Debugging

[#5426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5426): When using the recently-released Dart 3.8 / Flutter 3.32, "inline values" will show for local variables and parameters during debugging.

Additionally, the experimental setting `"dart.experimentalInlineValuesProperties": true` will enable inline values for getters (be aware that invoking getters may have side-effects in your program). If you try this feature out, please provide feedback on GitHub.

## Editor

- [#2785](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2785): You can now `Ctrl+Click`/`Cmd+Click` Pub package names in `pubspec.yaml` to open the related page on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). Additionally, [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed a similar feature to `Ctrl+Click` lint names in `analysis_options.yaml` to open the related documentation on [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/).

## Testing

- [#5480](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5480): When developing in the Dart SDK repository in packages that use `package:test_reflective_loader` (such as `analyzer` or `analysis_server`), the **Go to Test** actions now navigate to the test method instead of the call to `defineReflectiveTests`. When a test fails, the error popup will also show at this new location.

## Misc

- [#5515](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5515): The minimum version of VS Code for this version of the extension has been reduced from 1.96 to 1.75.
- [#5509](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5509): Recommendations for extensions (such as the Arb Editor) are no longer shown if the extension is already installed and enabled.

## Experimental Features

- [#5516](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5516): Debug sessions can be started automatically when opening a project by adding launch configurations in a file `.dart_tool/autolaunch.json`. The format of this file is exactly the same as `.vscode/launch.json`. This feature is experimental and may change over coming releases.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5507](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5507): [@FMorschel](https://github.com/FMorschel) contributed a fix to prevent code completion from incorrectly triggering inside dartdocs.
- [#5505](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5505): Labels in source code and now assigned the `label` `SemanticTokenType` allowing them to be themed or customised.
- [#5201](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5201): `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks are now foldable.
