# v3.80.0 _2023-12-27_

## Flutter

- [#4867](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4867): Running a script with a `cwd` set to another project no longer sometimes selects the wrong type of debugger (for example Flutter when trying to run a Dart CLI script from another project with the `cwd` set to a Flutter project)
- [#4904](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4904): The Flutter device daemon is now fully initialised before trying to query the supported platforms for a project. This may solve some race conditions that would prevent the correct devices from showing.
- [#4885](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4885): For new versions of Flutter, launching an application will not overwrite any custom Pub root directories set via DevTools (by using the `addPubRootDirectories` service instead of `setPubRootDirectories`).

## Editor

- [#4896](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4896): The "Add 'foo' to dependencies" quick-fix will no longer appear duplicated when both `uri_does_not_exist` and `depend_on_referenced_packages` diagnostics are produced.
- [#4808](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4808): Code completion now triggers automatically when typing inside an string interpolation expression.
- [#4719](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4719): When editing `.arb` files, a recommendation for the [ARB Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.arb-editor) extension may be shown.
- [#4897](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4897): [@hrishikesh-kadam](https://github.com/hrishikesh-kadam) contributed an update to the recommended settings to bring `editor.wordBasedSuggestions` inline with new values in VS Code 1.85.

## Debugger

- [#4906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4906): The default files created at `bin/(project_name).dart` in console applications are now treated as potential default entry points, just as `bin/main.dart` is.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#4891](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4891): Inlay hints are now shown for for-in loops and for elements in collections.
- [#4865](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4865): Format document no longer sometimes adds blank lines in file that use `\n` line endings after formatting another file using `\r\n` line endings.
