# v3.76.1 _2023-11-02_

- New survey prompts have been enabled for a small number of Flutter beta users.

# v3.76.0 _2023-11-01_

## Flutter

- [#4809](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4809): Running Flutter tests from a path that includes a `tool` segment within the `test` folder no longer uses `dart` and produces an error that `dart:ui` is unavailable.
- [#4778](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4778): The `dart.env` setting now correctly sets environment variables for the Flutter device daemon process which addresses some issues with custom `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` paths.

## Editor

- [#4807](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4807): When clicking the "Open Settings" button after accepting Dart's recommended settings or in warning notifications about invalid settings, the settings editor will now jump directly to the related setting.
- [#4822](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4822): The error "Unknown Outline item! EXTENSION" is no longer be printed to the console when working in files that contain extensions.
- [#4786](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4786): The change in [#4749](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4749) to prompt for a variable name when extracted locals has been reverted because it prevented the analysis-server-suggested name from being used (forcing you to always type a name). A future release may re-introduce if it can be done in a way that preserves the server-suggested name as a default.

## Commands

- [#4789](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4789): The `Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information` command will no longer include `flutter doctor` output for non-Flutter projects even if a Flutter SDK is available.
- [#4773](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4773): The **Go to Test/Implementation File** command now handles optional `src` segments in paths to handle jumping between `lib/src/foo.dart` and `test/foo_test.dart`.

## Flutter Sidebar

The Flutter sidebar is currently available when using the latest Flutter beta and will be available in a future stable Flutter release.

- [#4812](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4812): The `embed` flag is now set correctly so that the IDE theme colors are used correctly in the sidebar.
- [#4819](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4819): Devices for platforms that are not enabled for the current project are no longer shown in the sidebar.
- [#4818](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4818): Devices that are emulators will now show the emulator name (instead of device name) in the sidebar, matching what's shown in other locations such as the device quick-pick.


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs
