# v3.24.0 *2021-07-01*

## Dependencies View

[#3095](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3095): The dependencies view now has tooltips that show the shortest path from your package to a transitive dependency to help you understand where it comes from.

Note: This feature relies on an update to the [`pub deps`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-deps) command so may not be immediately visible depending on your SDK channel.

## Launch Configurations

[#3414](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3414): The explorer context menu now includes a command to quickly create a launch configuration in `launch.json` for a script and open it for editing. This makes it easier to switch between launching different files at the top of the Debug side bar.

- [#3434](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3434): The `"console"` field in `launch.json` that controls where Dart CLI scripts run now accepts an additional value `"externalTerminal"` that will spawn the script in an external terminal rather than using VS Code's integrated terminal.
- [#3431](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3431): Using the `"args"` field in `launch.json` for an `attach` request no longer reports that the field is invalid.

## Flutter

- [#3423](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3423): The **Enable {platform}** actions in the Flutter device selector now enable only the selected platform rather than all available platforms.
- [#3410](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3410): A notification is now shown if the Flutter device daemon terminates during startup (for example if the `dart.flutterAdditionalArgs` setting contains arguments not valid for `flutter daemon`).
- [#3366](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3366)/[#3381](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3381): [@Hamdor](https://github.com/Hamdor) contributed showing an option to cold boot Android emulators in the Flutter device selector.
- [#3364](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3364): Colors using the `Color.fromRGBO` constructor now show color previews in the

- [#3407](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3407): The "ignore {lint}" quick-fix now correctly appends to existing ignore comments instead of inserting new ones that would prevent the original ignores from working (requires SDK update).

- [#3385](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3385): Code completion now automatically triggers when completing the `import '';` snippet or selecting a folder when using LSP (requires SDK update).
- [#3374](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3374): The name part of named constructors are now coloured the same as methods (instead of classes) when using LSP (requires SDK update).
- [#3357](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3357): Hover tooltips now format method/function signatures over multiple lines as if formatted with trailing commas (requires SDK update).
- [#3335](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3335): A new "ignore {lint} for file" quick-fix allows ignoring a lint for an entire file in one go (requires SDK update).
- [#3308](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3308): The `void` keyword now has a semantic token modifier to allow its color to be customized differently to other keywords (requires SDK update).
- [#3269](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3269): An `export` directive that references a non-existent file now has a quick-fix to create the file (requires SDK update).
- [#3268](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3268): The quick-fix to create files from a `part` directive now prefills the library filename in the created file (requires SDK update).
- [#3259](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3259): The error message reported when failing to resolve includes in an analysis_options.yaml file now includes information about the project being used to resolve the package URI (requires SDK update).
- [#3071](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3071): Go-to-Definition on a conditionally imported filename now jumps directly to the file instead of showing a picker of all files in the directive (requires SDK update).

## Docs

- [#3367](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3367): The [FAQ entry](https://dartcode.org/faq/#why-cant-dart-code-find-my-dartflutter-sdk) on SDK location now details more places that the extension searches for SDKs.
