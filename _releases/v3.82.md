# v3.82.0 _2024-02-01_


## Editor

- [#4552](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4552): The "Go to Super" command is now available on the editor context menu.
- [#4957](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4957): Methods named `get`/`set` that have type arguments are no longer coloured like keywords when Semantic Tokens are disabled (or unsupported by the theme).


## DevTools

[#4387](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4387): The `dart.devtoolsLocation` setting has been updated to allow specifying different settings for each DevTools page.

### Before:

```js
"devToolsLocation": "beside" // "beside" | "external" | "active"
```

### After:

```js
"dart.devToolsLocation": {
	"default": "beside", // A default used for any pages not explicitly configured
	"cpu-profiler": "external" // Open CPU profiler externally always
},
```


## Debugger

- [#4966](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4966): The `dart.previewSdkDaps` setting has been replaced by a new `dart.useLegacyDebugAdapters`. The new setting has the opposite meaning (`true` means to use the legacy adapters, whereas for the old setting that was `false`).
- [#4930](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4930): Errors that occur when evaluating expressions (such as those triggered by Watch expressions that are no in scope) no longer trigger additional error notifications/toasts.
- [#4926](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4926): An issue that could cause Flutter apps to freeze when modifying breakpoints was fixed and hot-fixed into Flutter 3.16.9.


## Misc

- [#4705](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4705)/[#4847](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4847): Notifications may now be shown suggesting other VS Code extensions appropriate for the project and packages you are using.
