- Fixed an issue introduced in v0.15.0 where `null` would something appear in tooltips for items with no doc comments.

# v0.15.0

- Tooltips will now show include the name of the library that a type comes from.
- When the **Dart: Organize Directives** command fails (eg. due to a compile error) the correct message will be displayed instead of `[Object object]`
