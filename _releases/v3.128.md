# v3.128.0 _2026-02-02_

## Testing

[#5858](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5858)/[#5871](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5871): The Test Explorer now groups test suites under workspace/package folders, making tests in large workspaces easier to navigate.

- [#5879](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5879)/[#5891](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5891): Running specific tests no longer triggers discovery of all tests suites before launching.
- [#5883](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5883)/[#5878](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5878): Tracking of test locations (for gutter icons, etc.) now works across editors being closed and re-opened as long as the locations remain valid (and the file wasn't modified on disk).
- [#5798](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5798)/[#5875](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5875): Dart tests now collect coverage across all related packages in the workspace (matching the behaviour for Flutter tests), as long as the project uses `package:test` version 1.29.0 or later.

## Flutter

- [#5854](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5854)/[#5867](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5867): The `deviceId` and `emulatorId` fields in `launch.json` now support substring matches and matching on device ID and name.
- [#5728](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5728)/[#5880](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5880): When locating a Flutter SDK from a packages `.dart_tool/package_config.json` file, the `flutterRoot` field will be used in preference to inferring from the `flutter` package path.

## Editor

- [#5890](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5890): Changing the **Automatic Comment Slashes** setting now takes effect immediately without restarting VS Code.

## Debugging

- [#5855](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5855)/[#5869](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5869): `launch.json` now accepts `debuggerType` to force the kind of debugger and provides code completion for the valid values. Generally the extension should correctly detect the correct kind of debugger to launch so use of this field is discouraged unless you have specific/unusual requirements.

## Tasks

- [#5874](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5874)/[#5882](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5882): Tasks like `build_runner` are now invoked with `dart run`, preventing a warning about `flutter pub run` being deprecated.

## Misc

- [#5886](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5886): Many skipped Dart-Code tests have been re-enabled with a workaround for VS Code's behaviour of not firing document close events for up to three minutes after the editor was closed.
- [#5864](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5864): Dart-Code test coverage is now uploaded to Codecov as part of CI.
