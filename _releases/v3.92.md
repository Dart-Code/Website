# v3.92.0 _2024-07-02_

## Flutter

- [#5134](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5134): A new `flutter-default` web renderer option has been added and made the default. This setting will always use whatever the default renderer is for the current Flutter SDK, whereas the previous default `auto` setting will continue to select the renderer based on the device.
- [#5119](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5119): Trying to install Flutter through the extension will no longer hang on "Checking for git..." if `git` cannot be found and is not on `PATH`. Instead, an appropriate error will be shown and a button linking to the online installation instructions.
- [#5127](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5127): When the Dart VM binary inside Flutter is a symlink (as it is for some Flutter package managers), Dart SDK update checks will no longer run. Dart SDK update checks are only relevant for standalone Dart SDKs as Flutter manages the version for Flutter SDKs.
- [#5145](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5145): The iOS Language setting has been updated to indicate it will no longer apply for future Flutter SDKs (after 3.22) where Swift will always be used.

## Testing

- [#5094](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5094): VS Code's new standard "Run Tests" / "Debug Tests" entries in the explorer context menu now work for Dart and Flutter projects.

## Commands

- [#5126](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5126): The **Dart: Restart Analysis Server** command should no longer show multiple notifications about processes terminating that are expected behaviour during a restart.
- [#5159](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5159): The **Dart: Use Recommended Settings** command now accepts a `{ showNotification?: boolean }` flag that can be used to suppress the confirmation message when invoked programatically (such as during cloud IDE initial setup).

## DevTools

- [#5152](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5152): Some "Open DevTools" buttons/commands no longer silently fail when running the latest pre-release version of DevTools from source.
- [#5147](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5147): To support some upcoming changes to the Sidebar, the internal API now allows launching DevTools without supplying a debug session (in this case, a quick-pick will be shown to select a debug session or a single debug session will be selected automatically).

## Misc

- [#5133](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5133): Several legacy settings have been moved to the **Legacy** section in the settings UI and had their descriptions updated to make it clear those settings may only work for older SDKs.
- [#5151](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5151): Fixed a few small spelling mistakes in notification messages.
- [#5150](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5150): Updated flutter.dev links to use new redirect URLs to avoid website changes potentially breaking them.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be available to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5149](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5149): Closure completion suggestions now include types when the `always_specificy_types` lint is enabled.
- [#5142](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5142): The quick-fix for "Add missing switch cases" now adds all enum values instead of only the first.
- [#5139](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5139): Multiline string literals are now foldable.
- [#5128](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5128): Debugger views no longer show duplicates when a class hierarchy contains both fields and getters with the same name.
- [#4868](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4868): "Find all references" now treats field formal parameters as references to fields.
- [#4743](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4743): Flutter structured error summaries (shown when multiple errors occur since the last reload) are no longer missing information about the error-causing widget.
- [#4734](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4734): Breakpoints are now resolved eagerly and should turn red (if valid) immediately rather than only when the function first executes. Additionally, an issue that could cause breakpoints to appear to jump to the wrong line (even though internally they were still set on the requested line) has been resolved.
- [#5124](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5124): When attaching to Flutter web fails, the "Attaching..." notification no longer stays on screen and the failure message is now visible in the Debug Console.
