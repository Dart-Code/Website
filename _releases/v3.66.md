# v3.66.0 *2023-06-01*

## Editor

- [#4563](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4563): The Run/Debug editor button will no longer show for files that don't have a `main` function unless they are known entry files.
- [#4520](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4520): Syntax highlighting (shown with semantic tokens are unavailable or have not yet been computed) has been updated to resolve some issues with comments inside type parameters.

## Testing

- [#4557](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4557): Multiple test suites are now run using relative instead of absolute paths. This reduces the chance of "Command line too long" errors on Windows when running a large selection of test suites (either explicitly, or because exclusions require each suite to be passed to `dart test`/`flutter test` individually). Further improvements to this will be made in a future release via [#4553](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4553).

## Terminal

- [#4545](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4545): Setting `dart.addSdkToTerminalPath` to `false` now removes any SDK path that had already been added to `PATH` in the embedded terminal that VS Code would automatically re-apply after a restart.

## Commands

- [#4527](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4527): The default project names when using the **Dart: New Project** and **Flutter: New Project** commands have been updated to better reflect the kind of project. For example selecting the "package" template will provide a default name of `dart_package_1` instead of `dart_application_1`.

## Debugger

- [#4539](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4539): The `customTool` field in launch configuration is [now detailed on the Dart-Code website](/docs/launch-configuration/) and does not causing a warning in VS Code that it's not valid. This field is for advanced use where the `dart` or `flutter` tool need to be replaced by another (compatible) tool.

## Misc

- [#4556](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4556): A new setting `dart.analyzerAdditionalVmArgs` allows passing additional VM arguments when spawning the analysis server.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically after you upgrade to the next (non-hotfix) Dart/Flutter SDK release in future. If you're using a recent bleeding-edge version, these items should already be available to you and any issues should be reported on GitHub in the usual way.

- [#4535](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4535): Go-to-References on initializing formals now correctly finds references in calls to the function.
- [#4531](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4531): Go to Implementations no longer reports spurious results when implementations are provided by mixins in other files.
- [#4530](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4530): Code completion for filenames is now available for conditional imports.
- [#4521](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4521): Highlighting occurences of the selected variable now correctly includes variables declared by `for in` loops.
- [#4506](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4506): Code folding is now available for `switch` statements.
- [#4499](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4499): Code completion now longer sometimes shows types as nullable if they have been restricted to being non-nullable by another `implement`ed type.
- [#4498](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4498): Classes and constructors declaration now have the `declaration` semantic token modifier to allow them to be coloured differently by themes.
- [#4495](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4495): Unnamed constructors now have the  `constructor` semantic token modifier, matching named constructors.
- [#4473](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4473): The `class` snippet no longer shows up inside enum definitions.
