# v3.46.0 *2022-08-02*

## Editor

- [#3055](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3055): Actions that cause the extension to reload the language server (such as modifying SDK settings, or changing the selected SDK) no longer generate errors like "edit.sortMembers is already registered".
- [#4050](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4050): The default formatter for Dart files is now set explicitly. This prevents the Dart formatter from being disabled if another formatter sets itself as the global default. If required, this can be overridden by setting the `editor.defaultFormatter` setting inside the Dart-specific settings ("[dart]").

## Testing

- [#4042](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4042): Tests that include `<` or `>` in their names (but not immediately following quotes) no longer prevent tests from running using CodeLens links.

## Debugger

- [#4076](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4076): After updating the `path` of a dependency (or switching between a `path` and other type of dependency) in `pubspec.yaml` and then Hot Restarting, the debugger will no longer continue to jump to the original sources paths when breaking/stepping in the dependency.

## DevTools

- [#3944](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3944): A new setting `"dart.customDevToolsUri"` allows overriding the URI used when launching/embedded DevTools. This setting is intended for use by DevTools developers to simplify testing DevTools when embedded in VS Code.

## Other

- [#4028](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4028): Nested projects excluded from analysis using `analysis_options.yaml` are now also excluded when locating projects, including when deciding whether to use a Dart or Flutter SDK. This prevents the Flutter SDK being selected for Dart projects that may include nested Flutter projects for testing purposes (such as the project for the `linter` package).


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using beta/development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#4039](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4039): When using SDK debug adapters (via the `"dart.previewSdkDaps"` setting), exception popups now include the full exception text (matching the existing debug adapters). Migration to the SDK debug adapters by default will begin in an upcoming release.
- [#4053](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4053): The **Extract Method** refactor no longer incorrectly adds the `async` keyword to synchronous code that contained asynchronous callbacks.
- [#4031](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4031): Several issues with **Go to Definition** not navigating correctly on `super`/`this` formal params have been resolved.
