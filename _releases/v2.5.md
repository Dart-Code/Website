excerpt: Better handling of Chinese characters in paths, new debugger commands...
---

# v2.5.1

- Chinese characters in paths should no longer result in breakpoints not being hit during debugging

---

# v2.5.0

- A new **Dart: Open Observatory** command is now available during Dart and Flutter debugging sessions to launch Observatory in a browser
- A new **Dart: Open Timeline** command is now available during Flutter debugging sessions to launch the Observatory Timeline in a browser
- Closing Labels are now enabled by default when you are using a version of the SDK that supports it
  - A new option (`dart.closingLabels`) has been added to allow these to be disabled
- The setting `dart.flutterHotReloadOnSave` now defaults to `true` and will force a hot reload upon saving (if there are no errors in the file being saved)
- Progress messages will now be shown in the status bar when building/debugging Flutter projects
- Characters typed at the end of a line will no longer appear after the Closing Labels
- The `dart.sdkContainer` option (which adds a quick "SDK Picker") now works if pointing directly at an SDK instead of its parent
