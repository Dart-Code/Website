# v3.86.0 _2024-04-02_

## Editor

- [#5035](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5035): Modifying a `pubspec_overrides.yaml` file will now trigger `pub get` in the same way as modifying `pubspec.yaml`.
- [#5021](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5021): The Dart language status information (accessed from the `{}` icon next to the current editors language which shows the status of the Dart tooling services) is now visible for virtual Dart files that don't use the `file:` scheme.

## Flutter

[#5031](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5031): A new setting `dart.hotReloadPatterns` allows setting custom globs for which modified files should trigger a Hot Reload:

```js
"dart.hotReloadPatterns": [
	"**/*.md", // All .md files
	"**/assets/**", // Everything in assets
]
```

## Misc

- [#5025](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5025): When the `dart.openDevTools` setting is set to always open DevTools on starting a debug session, non-Flutter web apps will no longer trigger a prompt asking "Which DevTools page?" and will instead launch the default page.
- [#5020](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5020): The Dart Tooling Daemon is no longer spawned for internal Bazel workspaces where it may not be available.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be able to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5048](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5048): Flutter Outline, CodeLens and some other features that rely on outline information from the Dart Analysis Server are now sent for newly-opened files instead of requiring a modification to the file to show up.
- [#5047](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5047): "Run"/"Debug" CodeLenses no longer sometimes take up to 5s to appear or cause other CodeLenses to be delayed for 5s.
- [#5030](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5030): The VS Code Outline view will no longer sometimes fail to populate for files that were already open when VS Code launched.
- [#4938](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4938): When launching a Flutter app, more detailed build progress will now be shown in the toast notification.
