# v3.11.0 *2020-05-29*

## Preview: Update Imports on Rename

- [#548](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/548)/[#1740](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1740): A new setting (`dart.previewUpdateImportsOnRename`) has been added to enable automatically updating `import` statements when files are moved/renamed.

</video>

This feature currently only works for files (not folders) and only a single file at a time (please add thumbs up to [this VS Code issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98309)!).

## Improved Custom CodeLens for Tests and Main Functions

Improvements have been made to custom CodeLens for launch configurations. The existing `template` field on launch configurations has been deprecated and replaced with a new `codeLens` field.

- [#2459](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2459)/[#2466](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2466): A single launch configuration can now contribute multiple CodeLens links using `codeLens.for`.
- [#2458](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2458): A launch configuration can now specify that CodeLens links should only be shown within a sub-folder using `codeLens.path`.

For example, to add CodeLens for a launch config that sets a `RELEASE_MODE=true` environment variable to tests in `test/integration_tests`:

```js
{
	"name": "Current File (release mode)",
	"type": "dart",
	"request": "launch",
	"codeLens": {
		// Types of CodeLens to inject
		"for": [ "run-test", "run-test-file", "debug-test", "debug-test-file" ],
		// Restrict to certain folders
		"path": "test/integration_tests",
		// Text for CodeLens link (${debugType} will be replaced with "run" or "debug")
		"title": "${debugType} (release)"
	},
	"env": { "RELEASE_MODE": true }
}
```

This will insert additional CodeLens links into tests, groups and main functions:

## Global Expression Evaluation

- [#906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/906)/[#1062](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1062): Expression evaluation in the Debug Console now works when not paused at a breakpoint/exception.

Evaluation is not currently scoped to the file/class you have open in the editor.

## Commands

- [#2436](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2436)/[#2437](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2437): DevTools and other pub package updates are now correctly detected if they only vary by build metadata (`+xyz`), as described in [Pub's versioning scheme](https://pub.dev/packages/pub_semver).
- [#2430](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2430)/[#2432](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2432): If DevTools fails to launch, the error notification now includes a button to try re-activating the package.
- [#2414](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2414)/[#2418](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2418): `pub` and `flutter` commands will no longer show `.bat` suffixes in the output window on Windows.

## Debugger

- [#2428](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2428)/[#2469](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2469): When setting breakpoints in locations that will not be hit (for example in the Dart SDK when `dart.debugSdkLibraries` is set to `false`) a warning will be shown offering to change debug settings.
- [#2424](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2424)/[#2467](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2467): It's now possible to attach to processes using a `--write-service-info` file. This allows running arbitrary commands to spawn Dart processes that Dart-Code does not support (as long as they can use `--write-service-info`) and attach to them in a single step using a launch configuration with a `preLaunchTask`.
- [#2471](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2471): When starting a debug session, the VM Service URL is now printed to the Debug Console.
- [#2448](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2448): Conditional breakpoints with expressions that evaluate to numerics now work for web apps.
- [#2423](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2423): When using a new enough Dart SDK (v2.9.0 onwards) it's now possible to debug internal Dart libraries, such as `dart:http`.

## Editor

- [#2468](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2468): Code completion now shows full documentation instead of only a summary.
- [#2426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2426): Flutter Icons are now shown in the gutter when running in LSP mode.
- [#2425](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2425): Flutter UI Guides are now shown in the editor (if enabled) when running in LSP mode.

## Flutter

- [#2453](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2453): For web apps, the Chrome device will now be picked over the Web-server device by default.

## Testing

- [#2417](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2417): The test tree now shows test durations of the last run alongside the name.

## Misc

- [#2422](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2422)/[#2427](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2427): More of the work to find project roots at startup is now async, reducing the chance of triggering "Extension causes high CPU" warnings in VS Code.
- [#2476](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2476)/[#2481](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2481): `pub get` will no longer automatically run when saving a `pubspec.yaml` file in a Bazel workspace.
