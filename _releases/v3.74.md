# v3.74.0 _2023-10-02_

## Editor

- [#4749](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4749): The **Extract Local Variable** refactor now prompts for a name of the variable before extracting.
- [#4741](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4741): The order of label/value in the language status area has been reversed to match other VS Code extensions.
- [#4721](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4721): Violations of the `depend_on_referenced_packages` now show the quick-fix to automatically add the dependency.
- [#4718](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4718): A summary of debug sessions now appears in the language status area, with a command to quickly copy the VM Service URI to the clipboard.
- [#4615](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4615): The textmate grammar used for initial syntax highlighting has been updated to highlight `extension type`.

## Debugger

- [#4746](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4746): Template launch configurations (using `"templateFor"` in `launch.json`) now apply when running your project using the Run/Debug links in the editor title bar and from the explorer context menu.

## Remote

- [#4731](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4731): In remote workspaces (including web IDEs like Codespaces), the number of code completions included has been lowered to improve responsiveness. Typing additional characters will refresh the set of completions shown.
- [#4729](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4729): In remote workspaces, full documentation is no longer included for all items in code completion to improve responsiveness. This can be overridden using the `"dart.documentation"` setting.

## Devtools

- [#4722](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4722): External tools spawned by the extension (such as `dart devtools`) will now automatically have the `FLUTTER_TOOL` environment variable set, which may allow them to locate the Flutter SDK in some situations where they previously could not (and will help ensure they use the correct Flutter SDK if it's not the one on `PATH`).

## Commands

- [#4716](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4716): A new command **Dart: Collect Diagnostic Information** has been added to collect useful information (such as SDK version numbers and `flutter doctor` output) for reporting issues.
- [#4708](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4708): When using the SDK switcher, paths written in to `dart.sdkPath` and `dart.flutterSdkPath` will now use `~` (and forward slashes) when the SDK is inside your home directory. This is aimed to simplify sharing settings across machines/platforms.

## Testing

- [#4410](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4410): The Test Peek window should no longer show duplicated output for failed tests.

## Other

- [#4739](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4739): An error is no longer reported if the dependency tree runs `flutter pub deps --json` and triggers the first-run "Welcome to Flutter" notification.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. Some are already available in the current beta channels though some are currently only available on bleeding-edge builds and will show up in future beta/stable SDK releases.

- [#4758](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4758): "Wrap with ..." refactors no longer wraps an entire switch expression when only a single branch was selected.
- [#4757](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4757): Running **Fix All** with an unresolved `backgroundColor` reference will no longer sometimes replace `backgroundColor` with `colorScheme.background`.
- [#4732](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4732): The **Inline Local Variable** refactor no longer adds unnecessary parens when inlining an expression in a `switch` statement.
- [#4692](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4692): Stepping after an exception has occurred should no longer sometimes jump to the top of the file when the top stack frame is inside an anonymous closure.
- [#4762](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4762): A new panel is available on the Flutter side bar for selecting devices and launching DevTools for each debug session.
