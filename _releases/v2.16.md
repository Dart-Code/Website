# v2.16.0 *2018-07-16*

## Create Emulators

Emulators can now be created directly from the device selector.

The emulator created will be based on a standard Pixel device and named automatically.

This feature is only available when using a very recent Flutter SDK. Flutter's `master` channel already has the required functionality but it may take a little longer to filter through to the `beta` channel.

## Flutter Update Notification

When a new version of Flutter is available you'll now see a prompt in the editor.

Clicking the **Upgrade Flutter** button will execute `flutter upgrade` inside the editor and once complete automatically reload the SDK in the background.

This feature requires a recent version of Flutter that provides better update checking; therefore you might not see this prompt on the next update if you're on the current `beta` channel. Updates are only checked every few days so you might not see the prompt immediately when a new version is available.

## Dart Test Runner

The test runner included for Flutter in the previous version is now enabled for Dart projects. This will only work for tests that can be run with `pub run test` and therefore will only activate if there is a `.packages` and a `pubspec.yaml` file in the project root.

## Faded Dead Code

Unused imports/variables and dead code are now flagged to VS Code and will render slightly faded. You can control this with the `editorUnnecessaryCode` settings [as described here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_diagnostictag).

## Other Changes

- Projects in sub-folders (for example in an `example` folder) will now launch more reliably when pressing `F5` without needing to create a `launch.json`
- Whether the test view will be shown automatically on test runs can now be configured with `dart.openTestView` (an array that can be empty, or a combination of `testRunStart` and `testFailure`)
- Data provided to the VS Code Outline tree should now contain more accurate code ranges for each symbol and show parameter information for the selected node
- Commands like **Sort Members** and **Organize Imports** no longer rely on an active text editor, resolving issues when using [Folder Source Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.folder-source-actions) or [VS Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extensions
- Paths searched for SDKs at startup are now logged to the [extension log](https://dartcode.org/docs/logging/#extension) to aid troubleshooting
- Error messages shown at startup (such as when failing to locate an SDK) will now include a **Show Log** button to review [extension logs](https://dartcode.org/docs/logging/#extension)
- Go-to-Implementation now works from call sites in addition to declerations
- When terminating a test debug session and the test framework is allowing time for the current test to finish, a message will now be shown in the Debug Console (clicking the Stop button a second time will force immediate termination)
- Debugger tooltips/watch info for `Type` instances will now show the type name instead of just the word `Type`
- Launching a Dart VM script with `cwd` set to a Flutter project in the launch config will now correctly use the Dart debugger, not the Flutter one
- The Workspace Symbol list should now jump to the selected symbol more reliably
- Pressing `F5` with an open file that it outside of the project containing the selected debug configuration should no longer result in a failure to launch
- Comments within import/export statements will no longer break syntax highlighting for the rest of the file
- A new setting (`dart.analyzerSshHost`) has been added that allows running the analysis server over SSH on a remote machine to reduce latency when working on a remote file system (such as using SSHFS)
