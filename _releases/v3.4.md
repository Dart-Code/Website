# v3.4.1 *2019-09-04*

- [#1967](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1967): Running tests from CodeLens links will longer report "Running the contributed command failed".

# v3.4.0 *2019-09-03*


## Custom Test CodeLens

- [#1901](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1901)/[#1916](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1916) It's now possible to create custom launch configurations for running your tests, for example to pass different arguments or environment variables to the test run.

These are standard launch configurations in a `launch.json` with the `template` field set to `run-test` or `debug-test` depending on whether you want to run in debug mode or not.

```js
"configurations": [
	{
		"name": "Main application",
		"program": "bin/main.dart",
		"request": "launch",
		"type": "dart",
	},
	// Test launch config templates
	{
		"name": "Run in Browser",
		"request": "launch",
		"type": "dart",
		"template": "run-test",
		"args": [
			"-p",
			"chrome"
		]
	},
	{
		"name": "Debug in Browser",
		"request": "launch",
		"type": "dart",
		"template": "debug-test",
		"args": [
			"-p",
			"chrome"
		]
	}
]
```

Note: The launch config is used only when running from the CodeLens links and not when running from the test explorer context menu. This [will be improved](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1951) in an upcoming release.


## Flutter Outline

[#605](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/605)/[#961](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/961)/[#1932](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1932): The Flutter Outline tree added [in the previous release](/releases/v3-3/#preview-flutter-outline) is now enabled by default. Please continue to raise issues on GitHub with any issues or feedback.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.4/flutter_outline.png" width="700" height="295" />

This functionality can be disabled with the `dart.flutterOutline` setting.


## Improved Flutter Errors

[#1870](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1870)/[#1910](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1910): Support for improved Flutter error messages added [in the previous release](/releases/v3-3/#preview-improved-flutter-errors) is now enabled by default. Please continue to raise issues on GitHub with any issues or feedback.

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/release_notes/v3.4/structured_errors.png" width="700" height="295" />

This functionality can be disabled with the `dart.flutterStructuredErrors` setting.


## Flutter

- [#1924](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1924): The **Flutter: New Project** command will now create projects using Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) by default. These can be configured with the `dart.flutterCreateAndroidLanguage` and `dart.flutterCreateIOSLanguage` settings.
- [#1943](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1943): A new setting `dart.flutterAndroidX` enables passing the `--androidx` flag when running the **Flutter: New Project** command.
- [#1905](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1905)/[#1909](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1909): A new setting `dart.flutterAdditionalArgs` allows custom arguments to be passed to all invocations of Flutter. For example, this allows passing `--local-engine` to enable running with a locally built engine.
- [#1933](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1933): The **Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor** command will now always run with the verbose `-v` flag.
- [#1919](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1919): A race condition that caused devices to stop showing up in VS Code for some users in the last version has been fixed.


## Editor

- [#1931](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1931): Using VS Code key-bindings to open a filtered list of refactors was broken in the previous release by an optimisation but has now been fixed.
- [#1937](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1937): Opening a loose Dart file outside of any folder is not currently supported, but used to fail in silent and confusing ways. A suitable notification is now shown the first time this happens per-session.
- [#1944](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1944): A new setting `dart.additionalAnalyzerFileExtensions` allows additional file extensions to be included in analysis to help those developing analyzer plugins that handle non-Dart source files.
- [#1930](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1930): The `extension` keyword is now correctly colored.


## Commands

- [#1302](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1302): A new command has been added **Dart: Use Recommended Settings** that will write some [recommended Dart settings](/docs/recommended-settings/) to your VS Code user settings (in the `"[dart]"` section). These settings address some common complaints around code completion and highlighting behaviour as well as enabling automatic formatting. Please try them out and send any feedback about these recommendations.
- [#1760](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1760): When Chrome is not installed, DevTools will now launch in the default browser instead and show a warning that it may be unsupported.
- [#1416](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1416): The **Dart: Capture Logs** notification is now shown as a progress notification which means it will no longer collapse into the bell icon after some seconds have passed.
- [#1906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1906): A new command **Dart: Stop Logging** has been added that performs the same function as clicking **Cancel** on the logging notification.
- [#1917](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1917): Command output will no longer sometimes show `[undefined]` where the folder name should be.
- [#1897](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1897): The **Open in Android Studio** context menu item should now work more reliably across different versions.


## Debugger

- [#1927](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1927): When editing a package that does not have its own entry points, pressing `F5` without a `launch.json` will now check for an `example/` project to launch instead of failing with an error.
- [#1911](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1911): Non-source stack frames in errors like `<async suspension>` are now dimmed like SDK frames instead of bright red.
- [#1942](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1942): Running scripts from the `.dart_tool` folder will now always run on the Dart VM (even for Flutter projects) to simplify debugging of code generator scripts.


## Other

- [#1896](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1896): The **Locate SDK** button now correctly saves the folder you select to your user settings.
- [#1907](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1907): When running in a remote environment (for example using VS Code remoting functionality), browser windows spawned (for example when opening DevTools) will now automatically tunnel ports to avoid having to set them up manually.
- [#1384](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1384): In the latest VS Code release, a Dart icon was added to the default Seti icon theme ðŸŽ‰.
