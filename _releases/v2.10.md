# v2.10.0

- When the Dart or Flutter SDK could not be located, a "Locate SDK" button is shown to allow browsing to the SDK manually
- The **Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor** command is now available outside of having a Flutter project open
- Many Flutter debug toggles (debug painting, performance overlay, debug mode banner, slow animations) will now persist across a `Hot Restart`
- Exception tooltips will now show the `toString()` of the exception rather than just the type name
- Exception information will now show in the `Variables` debugger pane
- Searching for symbols across the workspace now uses a much faster API (this requires a *very* recent SDK build and will fall back to the slower method for older SDKs)
- The dependency tree explorer now shows file icons
- Refactorings from the lightbulb menu are now keybindable! See the readme for full details
- The Flutter SDK is now correctly detected from the `.packages` file of a project on Windows
- If your Flutter SDK does not yet have a cached Dart SDK a more appropriate message will now be shown
- Code completion tabstops may now provide more specific completion suggestions for some actions
- A spinner will now be shown in the status bar during Flutter build progress messages
- Previously hidden settings for debug log files are now visible to aid completion/validation when setting them
