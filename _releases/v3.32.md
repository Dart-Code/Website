# v3.32.0 *2022-01-02*

[#3729](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3729): Pre-release channels are now available for the Dart and Flutter extensions. These channels will replace the manual vsix builds for preview/beta extension releases usually distributed via GitHub. These will usually be published a few times per month prior to stable releases.

If you'd like to help test new versions of the extensions before releases, you can switch to them using the buttons on the extensions pages within VS Code. You can switch back to the Release channel at any time.

While the VS Code marketplace doesn't support pre-release version numbers, pre-release versions will be in the format `x.ODD.YYYYMMDD` format while release versions will be in the format `x.EVEN.y`. Pre-release channel users will always get the latest version of the extension, which may be a release version until a subsequent pre-release version is published after each stable release.

## Testing

- [#3714](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3714): The **Test: Run All Tests** command now works correctly without needing to first open the Testing tab.
- [#3713](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3713): The names of **Run All Tests** test runs in the Debug Console panel will now use the projects folder name instead of just showing the name of the first file run.
- [#3712](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3712): Tests that are more than 5 levels deep inside your workspace will now be detected as long as they are somewhere within a detected project folder.

## Flutter

- [#3727](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3727): The **Tests: Run All Tests** command no longer fails with "Integration tests and unit tests cannot be run in a single invocation" for projects with both types of tests. Instead, two debug sessions will be spawned - one running all unit tests, and one running all integration tests.

## Commands

- [#3746](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3746): Changing project settings while creating a new Flutter project will now be reflected in the UI immediately.
- [#3735](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3735): The **Dart: Add Dependency** command now trims package names to make it easier to copy/paste from the Pub website.

## Debugger

- [#3741](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3741): Long lines printed with `dart:developer`'s `log()` function no longer output additional surrounding quotes.
- [#3715](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3715): The **Hot Reload** and **Profiler** buttons are now available on the debug toolbar for non-Flutter applications and will run the **Dart: Hot Reload** or **Dart: Open DevTools CPU Profiler** commands respectively.

## Editor

- [#3731](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3731): Code completion for version numbers in `pubspec.yaml` will no longer sometimes return incorrect results after modifying the file.
- [#3728](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3728): The **Add '{package}' to dependencies** fix no longer fails with "Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined".
- [#742](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/742): The `.dart_tool` folder is now included in VS Code's watch exclusion list by default.

## DevTools

- [#3750](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3750): A new setting `dart.updateDevTools` has been added that allows disabling auto-updates of DevTools via Pub. This applies only to older SDKs that do not ship with their own bundled version of DevTools.

## Features Enabled with Future SDKs

These items rely on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They will show up automatically when you update your SDK in future (or if using development channels depending on the exact version).

- [#3734](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/3734): The **Create constructor to call super()** fix now includes required named parameters as well as positional parameters.
