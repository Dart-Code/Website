## Fix All in Workspace Commands

[#5022](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5022): When using Flutter 3.22 / Dart 3.4, new commands **Dart: Apply Fix All in Workspace** and **Dart: Preview Fix All in Workspace** are available.

The **Apply** version of the command will fix all auto-fixable issues across the whole workspace, similar to running `dart fix`. The **Preview** version of the command will open VS Code's refactor preview allowing you to choose which fixes to apply. You can use the context menu to group these changes by the issue that they are fixing (add üëç to [this VS Code issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/207580) if you'd like to see this enabled by default and [to this VS Code issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/207578) for having the changes ticked by default).

## Automatically Close DevTools on Debug End

[#5029](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5029): A new setting **Dart: Close DevTools** (`dart.closeDevTools`) has been added to allow automatic closing of embedded DevTools windows like the Widget Inspector when a debug session ends. The `ifOpened` option will close only embedded windows that were opened automatically as a result of the **Dart: Open DevTools** (`dart.openDevTools`) setting.

## DevTools

- [#5116](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5116): Dragging an embedded DevTools window out into its own VS Code Window no longer results in a blank page but instead reloads the tool (at this time, any state within the tool may be reset).
- [#5046](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5046): Actions that trigger a restart of the DevTools server will now cause embedded DevTools windows to be reloaded so that they can be reconnected to the new server/Dart Tooling Daemon.


## Misc

- [#5084](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5084): The Dart language server will now be terminated more reliable/quickly when closing VS Code during initial analysis of very large workspaces.


## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. They may be able to test in the current beta/master channels and will show up in future SDK releases.

- [#5113](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5113): Analysis errors will no longer sometimes reappear for deleted/moved files if an analyzer plugins generate new diagnostics after the delete/move.
- [#5072](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/5072): Output to `stdout` (such as from `print`) during debug sessions will now be scanned for paths/package URIs that can be made clickable links in Dart projects when using the SDK debug adapters.
- [#4711](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4711): Output to `stdout` (such as from `print`) during debug sessions will now be scanned for paths/package URIs that can be made clickable links in Flutter projects when using the SDK debug adapters.
