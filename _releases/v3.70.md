# v3.70.0 *2023-08-??*

## Editor

- [#4637](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4637): A new setting `dart.sdkSwitchingTarget` allows you to configure the SDK Picker to modify the selected SDK globally, instead of only for the current workspace.
- [#4630](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4630): The "SDK configured in dart.[flutter]sdkPath is not a valid SDK folder" warning message now opens the specific settings file that configures the invalid path (instead of always User Settings).

## Flutter

- [#4632](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4632): The Flutter device picker now shows the IDs of devices so that two devices of the same kind can be differentiated.

## Testing

- [#4586](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4586): Test gutter icons will no longer show on the wrong lines on Windows when using functions that wrap calls to `test()` (such as Flutter's `testWidgets`). This fix requires updating to the latest version of `package:test` for Dart projects, and will require a future Flutter SDK release for Flutter.

## Misc

- [#4652](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4652): Connecting to a remote Live Share session from Windows will no longer sometimes try to analyze your local disk.

## Features/Fixes Enabled with Future SDKs

The following items depend on changes to the Dart/Flutter SDKs that have not yet been released to stable channels. Many are already available in the current beta channels though some are currently only available on bleeding-edge builds and will show up in future beta/stable SDK releases.

- [#4518](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4518)/[#4159](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4159)/[#1831](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1831): The new **Move to File** refactoring is no longer behind an experimental flag.
- [#4573](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4573): Some stack traces printed to the Debug Console will no longer try to open files using incorrect relative paths when clicking on the filename on the right side.
- [#4636](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4636): Basic evaluation support is now available from the Debug Console when execution is not paused.
- [#4106](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4106): The **Open Symbol in Workspace** search is now significantly faster for workspace with large numbers of projects.
- [#4364](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4364): Code completion inside files that are `part of` libraries with a large number of files is no longer extremely slow when the results contain snippet or `@override` completions.
- [#4561](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4561): When the **Fix All** command (`"source.fixAll"`) is triggered automatically (for example because it was added to `"editor.codeActionsOnSave"`), removing unused imports is now excluded. If you want to remove unused imports on save, you can additionally add `"source.organizeImports"` to `"editor.codeActionsOnSave"`.
- [#4576](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4576): The **Fix All** command now applies fixes iteratively, so if the result of applying one fix causes a warning that also has a fix, that will be resolved too.
- [#4621](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4621): The **Convert to StatelessWidget** refactor now correctly removes instances of `widget.` inside function expressions.
- [#4627](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/4627): Hovering over an identifier declared in a `for` loop variable now shows the type.
