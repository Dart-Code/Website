title: Key Bindings
---

Many of the key bindings you'll use for Dart Code come from VS Code itself. You can find a PDF reference guide of these by clicking **Help -> Keyboard Shortcut Reference**. Below is a list of shortcuts that were added by Dart Code or from VS Code that may find useful for Dart and Flutter development.

You can easily configure your own key bindings, including binding to commands provided by Dart Code by running the **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts** command from the command palette and following the instructions in the [VS Code Key Binding docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).
